{"I've had a few pairs of Club C's in my time, and I've loved each one of them. The details on the box and all around the shoe are awesome. The off white almost cream color of the shoe pairs well with alot of different clothing. I've been told by a few people who recognize the Hot One's logo on the shoe that they love the show and it's a fun conversation starter as well. And I love the extra set of laces you get with the shoes.": "5", "my favorite shoes! this is the second time i bought these shoes because I loved them so much! my last pair lasted a year (i used them almost everyday)!!": "5", "These are my favorite shoes and the only shoes I wear. Very comfortable and I'm so satisfied with these shoes.": "5", "I gifted a pair of these shoes to my brother for Christmas and he said they're fantastic.": "5", "Reebok is one of the best brands out in my opinion no cap": "5", "These shoes look great with any outfit. They bring a little spice to my style. Love them lots. Exquisite material. AF1? What are those? Reebok for the win": "5", "Great product that fits correctly and feels comfortable on my feet.": "5", "I ordered my typical size because I plan to wear these more in the spring, summer, fall weather. My left foot fits absolutely perfect. My right foot however is a little tight. Had I gone up a size I think they would have been too big so I'm happy I got my normal size. I just need to break in my right shoe a little and they'll be perfect!": "5", "Looks like something they haven't seen before! Since some of the front is transparent, the sock game must be right.": "5", "I ordered these to my size but the fit was too tight around the toes. I'd recommend ordering a half size or full size larger.": "3", "Purchased and met my expectations if not, would not have received my ratings.": "5", "Awesome shoes. Just that it was slightly big. Usually get women's size 7 for Reeboks, and these were men's 5.5. On their size chart this is equivalent to women's 7, but these were a tad bit larger. Will probably return them and get a smaller pair.": "4", "Got these for a friend for secret Santa and she loved them": "5", "I was browsing the website and my wife decided that she wanted this shoe. The women's section had too many \"girly\" shoes and she fell in love with this. She is a size 6.5W and bought a size 5 in men's for her. It looks great and fits her fine.": "4", "I bought my first pair of these last summer and really liked them. I wanted a pair in blue also but I wish the laces were also blue. I know, change them simple fix. When they arrived I couldn't get my foot in them, turns out that even though the box and both shoes were labeled 15 they were actually a 13 or 14. I'm not sure how that happens with any quality control but apparently it does.": "5", "Best pair of timeless sneakers. The material, comfort and style is one of the best. My father's all time favorite shoes!": "5", "Thought these would be good to teach in and wear all day. Not so much. They feel heavy.

They are so sleek and stylish for a 17 year old like myself, and the quality to budget ratio may be the best out there. I have a very expensive pair of white leather sneakers so to have these in tandem where I don't have to worry about beating them up, it's the perfect shoe for me.": "5", "I got these for my husband for Christmas. He had previously bought me a pair and I was so blown away by their comfort that I knew I had to get him his own pair. He was so impressed and said that they were his favorite gift this year.": "5", "Great style and fit. A comfortable walking around shoe!": "5", "Worked in corporate for 12 years, ill never wear heels again thank goodness.

Sizing chart was helpful in order to pick the right size.": "5", "Purchase won't be disappointed a good summer shoe with support.": "5", "my son was thrilled to receive these for Christmas.  I told him if he didn't like them he could wear them to work but he wore them out and his friends were reminiscing about how they all wore the\"gangstaboks\" back in the day.  A classic for sure.": "5", "Takes me back to my teen years.  Old school feel and the quality is superb.": "5", "Great product. Recommend to all. Good quality and fit.": "5", "Good shoes for everyday use. I typically wear mens 6 but these fit a half size too small. Other than that the width of the shoe is perfect, they're comfortable (once you get the right size). Material isn't cheap. You can dress them up or down.": "4", "I was  looking for a winter shoes; not those ugly boots. So I checked this shoes an it just nice to wear. All season shoes for the temperature, not icy conditions.": "4", "This was a great buy.  The fit is perfect and it feels like I'm walking on air.  Great product.": "5", "I first got the club c for myself. And my boyfriend had to have a pair too. We really love the look and feel. Matches with everything. It's our first pair and definitely not our last. Fresh til death with Reebok": "5", "The shoes are so cute I love them and they are great quality!

Materials and quality are amazing, and the subtle details just hit perfectly.": "5", "I love this shoe. Nice and simple yet modern and hip!": "4", "The color of the picture is not the same when you get the shoes.": "2", "I bought this pair for my boyfriend. He expected the mid-sole area to look more smooth, but it was a heavy dotted rubber texture. I believe the texture also made coloring of r sole look different than that of the shoe.": "3", "I have flat feet and they don't pressure an arch, which is why I'm so happy with the purchase. Plus they are just so perfectly colored.": "5", "These are SO comfortable.  This is my 3rd or 4th pair over the last 5 or 6 years.  I've never worn them out, just replace them because I like the smell and feel of new ones.": "5", "The style is simple yet unique and the size (6) was on spot. Personally I wouldn't recommend for long walks, it's more of a stylish look than every day use. The dark color sole was what sold me due to the shoe being overall white but with a dark color it gives it accent, especially since it would look overall dirty if the bottom was a light color.": "5", "Love them. Trendy and comfortable. Will purchase again.": "5", "Great looking shoe, truly incredible design. The toes are so creased and deformed after one wear though that they're not practical.": "3", "I LOVE THESE SHOES, they are so amazing and so cute. they match with everything!": "5", "These shoes are made very poorly.After 3 hours and 1/8 of a mile walking, the leather is starting to tear. Also, the green Reebok logo on the heel is smearing too! All I did today was walk to my car, drive to a restaurant, and drive back. That's it. These shoes are already falling apart. I'm very very disappointed.": "1", "These shoes are easy to maintain and clean when they get dirty.  They are extremely comfortable as well.": "5", "Comfortable, good looking shoe! I've received several compliments!": "5", "Good shoe.  Comfortable and good looking.  Would recommend.": "4", "Good Quality.

Looks exactly like the picture and true to size. Excellent quality, comfortable and affordable.": "5", "These shoes were the perfect fit and performance without having to break them in. The leather is easily washed and they work with my casual outfits.": "5", "I think it was really cool that the collection varied in simplicity but still retained that hot ones design. The lines are seamless and quite comfortable for a daily sneak.": "5", "Great pair of kicks. Highly recommended as your next shoe choice.": "5", "These are great looking sneakers that go well with today's tapered leg pants. Love the look and fit. They are sized perfectly.": "5", "love it the product very comfortable and look good": "5", "These shoes are so clean, stylish, and comfortable! They're my go-to shoes now.

Great for skateboarding or just walking the block.": "5", "I have worn a 500 pairs of sneakers in my day and this ranks near the top! Work or play they are appropriate! Great value and great quality!": "5", "Shoes look great and seem to be well made. I got them to replace my Nike AF1s that were falling apart after only a few months of use. The shoes are narrow and run smaller (comparing to AF1s in the same size), however, I am a female  and these are advertised as men's shoes so that may have something to do with it?  Also noticed they are much lower cut on the ankle than AF1s, and although this does not bother me personally, it may be helpful for other people to know!": "5", "These shoes are fairly similar to most Club C Shoes. I do love the collaboration with Hot Ones. Well made and feel like they will last a long time.": "5", "I was so excited to buy this shoe it's great just like all the rebel c": "5", "It was just okay for me. Not comfy. Quite disappointed on my first order.": "3", "Great retro shoe - however, it feels different than the ones I originally purchased in the mid-70's,  they had more cushion or padding than these in the sole.  Quality is otherwise great!": "4", "These shoes were stylish, very comfortable (purchased wide width) Love them.": "5", "My little brother said he wanted a nice Reebok for the holiday and I bought this for n he love it so much": "5", "This is my first Club C sneaker and I'm happy that it's a Hot Ones collab as it's one of my current favorite shows. Love the small details in the shoe and it's not too flashy. I can rock this shoe with my street wear outfits and look nice.": "5", "I've never gotten as many compliments on a shoe as I have with this one.  It has that classic look that draws the eye and someone has said something to me almost every time I've worn them.  More importantly, though, I love the look of them and they are very comfortable.  This is my go-to casual sneaker.": "5", "Looks good and fits as expected. Well made.   Would recommend": "5", "I thought these were really cute I just needed a half size smaller": "5", "I love the style and look of the sneakers. But they were a little uncomfortable. I had to buy some Dr Scholl's inserts and they are perfect now. Given that I got them for a great price, I am okay with this.": "3", "Overall a great shoe! Love the design and all of the thought that went into this collaboration! My first pair of Reebok's and I was worried about the sizing but they fit great and are comfortable!": "5", "Droopy made classic Reebok style  even better   It feels a bit small for me so try your size and half size bigger to decide which one fits best.": "5", "Killer shoes, super comfy, awesome look too. What an awesome shoe.": "5", "Fantastic shoe. I was happy to see this collab and glad I own a pair. Size was perfect and it was very comfortable.": "5", "Shoe is great, however it seems like they were broken into but it could be just the material. Overall... Satisfied": "4", "Stylish and durable. I love the soft leather. The more wear on the shoe the better it will get. This is my third pair!": "5", "Sick shoes! The comfort is on point. You can style with them with anything": "5", "One of my favorite shoes  collaborating with an equally awesome YouTube series is my dream come true. I love how simple, yet stylish these shoes are, and the color compliments almost everything I wear. Size runs true to size and the shoes themselves feel comfortable and light.Love!": "5", "Would buy it again, wish it had less white. But this is a classic": "5", "Was looking for a white sneaker and had the choice between club Cs and air forces. Think i made the right choice.": "4", "Very soft shoes love them. I wear them for work they very comfortable": "4", "Really cool sneakers: comfortable and well made. On the small side, though.": "5", "They're simple, clean, comfortable and basic. The fit is good but typical Reebok's they do come a tad big. I wear 10.5 in every brand but I'm probably a true size 10 in Reebok.": "5", "I have purchases Reebok shoes  both in stores and on line.  They are a comfortable walking shoe.  When I buy them on line I know they'll fit because of the good quality control.  the size doesn't  vary from batch to batch.  This allows me to be able to buy them on line with out the worry that they may not fit, or that they will not be comfortable.  They are always comfortable and last a long time.": "5", "These shoes fit every outfit I have!! I love them and will buying another pair!!": "5", "I am very pleased with these shoes and the gummy sole. They were exactly what I was looking for.": "5", "I sought this \"vintage\" model sport shoe.  So glad that it was available with subtle upgrades.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I would recommend this model to all.": "5", "A good fitting sneaker but may be a bit wide if you have a narrow foot as I do.  Comfortable and pretty durable.": "4", "super cute and goes with quite anything. the material was a little surprising to me but nothing terrible!": "5", "Love these shoes so much I want to buy another pair.": "5", "As expected. Good quality. That's all I can really say": "5", "very comfortable and look amazing! They are comfortable and have a wonderful fit all the way around.": "5", "I have really enjoyed them after wearing them for about two weeks now. Great quality, handle wear very well and keep clean. Minimal design with the nice accents make these a killer in the black with gum/natural soles. Perfect color combo for pretty much anything I wear. Really liked these and will get another pair at some point.Only gripe; they are definitely narrow. Once I grab a few more pairs of kicks I will really enjoy these more. As a pair of shoes you plan on wearing for a while, you may find some discomfort after a few hours of wearing them.": "4", "Love this collab. Shoes are of excellent quality as always. The box is what did it for me, big fan of all collars but this one is one of my favorites.": "5", "It is very well made, the sizing was a bit too small": "5", "Comfortable, is if it had been worn in for years! Also very stylish.": "5", "Great Shoe - the most comfortable fit I've had in an athletic shoe.": "5", "These shoes are very nice. The shoes are slightly small because I have wide feet. Other than that it's been great as an everyday shoe! Would buy again.": "5", "I've always wanted these shoes and I finally purchased them. The package arrived right on time. The shoes are very nice, fit perfectly and are very comfy. Highly recommend.": "5", "Would recommend it. The classic shoe holds it reliability and is a go to standard.": "5", "Honestly can't speak enough on these. Another slept on classic collab. All the little details elevate the shoe above the average collab. Nothing is overstated, and on first look one might not even recognize them as a Tom and Jerry shoe. However, upon closer inspection it becomes clear. From the cheese color to the slight pink hints, the embroidered patches to the Jerry face on the tough tag. Over all a perfect custom!": "5", "I bought this pair of Club C 85 with the Zig Kinetica Pride shoes together and love both of them. The Zig Kinetica Pride is no longer available so I'm just writing the reviews here. First of all, they both fit just about perfect and true to size.  Obviously, they look great and my biggest dilemma is which pair to wear most of the time. The colors are vibrant just like the pictures here.   I wear the Club C for day to day walking and the Zig Kinetica at work (I'm an ER nurse so really rough on shoes).  They are both comfortable though I personally prefer the Zig Kinetica over the Club C.  Top of the Club C feels a little tight so I typically try not to tie it too tight and then it's ok.  The Zig Kinetica is super comfortable and it's almost like walking on clouds.  I've got lots of compliments with both pairs and would love to buy more in the future.": "5", "I got these for my job, they are super comfortable plus are stylish enough to wear at other times. The perfect shoe for me!": "5", "Exactly what I wanted.  Low price and quick delivery.": "5", "I normally wear an 8 in women's shoes and I ordered a 7 in men. They were slightly big, but not too bad. I wear them often.": "5", "Trendy and looks so good! Great style super clean.": "5", "Great classic shoes goes with everything, I can match this shoe with allOutfits": "5", "Love these shoes. Look great with jeans or shorts going out or casual": "5", "Over all this shoe is great, I love the style, but the only problem is that the sizes run slightly small. I ordered a size 9 which is what I usually wear & it feels like an 8 1/2. My advice would be to order a half size or 1 full size bigger than what you normally wear because the shoe may feel fine at first, but after you've been walking around for a couple hours you definitely feel the discomfort around the toes. The width was fine for me, I have slim feet. If you have wide feet I don't recommend this shoe.": "4", "I've been wearing this exact shoe style for 20+ years and I've never found a more comfortable \"dress\" shoe.": "5", "Perfect for summer! Super comfy. Fit perfectly. Love the little green.": "5", "My son got the burgundy Club C Coast shoes. He loves them. The color is exactly what he was looking for and the comfort is great. Definitely would order again": "5", "Fit was perfect and comfort not as comfort as my previous Reeboks due to more material and support.": "5", "Very comfortable and minimalistic style. Already bought the same shoe in different colors!": "5", "I would recommend this shoe for any kind of occasion. Works well for casual, but also has a classy colorway that can be dressed up or down. Love the way it fits, and does not hurt when walking.": "5", "Soft and vibrant when the light hits them. I really like these shoes.": "4", "These are perfectly fine but I hadn't realized these were not leather.": "5", "It is a rare thing for me these days that when I order a product on line that it ends up being better than expected.  That is definitely true of these Club C Coast's.  Style, fit, comfort and everything else you would want in a casual summer kick.": "5", "This is the perfect sneaker with nicer shorts or khakis. Love the simple look with not alot of stuff added on. Very comfortable with plenty of padding around ankle. Very well made. Highly recommend.": "5", "I love these shoes. I have wide feet and was worried that they would be too narrow. But they are so comfy! They fit perfect for the spring weather and go with everything I wear. Best part is after wearing them all day my feet are not sore.": "5", "The colorway pops. Can be worn as a dinner shoe or a diner shoe.": "4", "Reebok Classics are great been wearing them for the past 20 years, great support, comfortable, feet are never sore, wouldn't buy anything else": "5", "Love this shoe I just wish you had it in my size in the other colors": "5", "The shoes are more than what I have expected.  They are very comfortable for walking": "5", "Very comfortable!    I got the pink ones and love them.   True to size.": "5", "There are a lot fancy shoes out there but I can always rely on Reebok meeting my expectations. I'm in my 70s now but I still expect my shoes to function and meet my needs. Reebok continues to do that.": "5", "Was wanting some all black freshness. These delivered.  Sharp looking. Comfy. Little Reebok branding accents set them off nicely.": "5", "A definite buy if u like looking classic & cool at the same time!": "5", "great shoe. reasonable price. timely shipping. runs small. had to return for half size larger.": "4", "Great gear for walking. will recomend to friends. thanks for purchase": "5", "Don't ever stop making these.

Love the style and comfort of these. Bought two pairs.  And will be buying more.": "5", "The shoe are perfect size but only if you wear them with thin socksThe quality is excellent": "5", "Reebok is a Excellent company, This will not be my first or last purchase.": "5", "Super comfortable! Great for walking around and walking long distances!": "5", "Love them. Well made. Just like back in the day!": "5", "I think I going to get another colorI like prefer hightop": "5", "I love the style and comfort of the shoe it's a lightweight shoe that basically goes with anything": "5", "This is the perfect sneaker with nicer shorts or khakis.  Love the simple look with not alot of stuff added on.  Very comfortable with plenty of padding around ankle.  Very well made.  Highly recommend.": "5", "The comfort is good and the quality of the materials are very nice.": "5", "Love them.  Well made.  Just like back in the day!": "5", "The shoe is all around good to wear for any occasion.": "5", "The shoes came exactly as advertised. I was super excited to open the package. It is the exact size I ordered - does not fit too small or big. I've worn these shoes to work, to the park, to run errands... they are perfect for casual every day wear.": "5", "I was between a Men's 12 and 13. They don't have half sizes, but since reviews said they run big I got a 12 and it turned out being too small. I'll be sizing up to the 13. Love the shoe though.": "4", "Great quality and style. Looks good with almost everything": "5", "I love how comfortable they are, love the color also.": "5", "These are dope like idk what else to say they look dope in the picture they fit great and are dope.": "5", "Great quality,and comfortable.

I love the materials and comfort.  Would highly recommend.": "5", "Great shoes, can't complain. Look great, feel great, I've gotten a TON of compliments. They're classics for a reason.": "4", "The material inside the shoe makes it hard to wear socks I gotta be pulling up my socks like every minute. The material inside is really bad": "1", "Very comfortable for everyday use! And they can go with any outfit!": "5", "I am an older guy who would buy the OG model for as long as I can remember.  I was very disappointed when it was pulled from the line and replaced with a look-a-like that definitely didn't fit and feel like the original.  It was missing the sturdiness and arch support of the original.  I have not been able to find a suitable replacement.  I am SO happy that the OG model is back!": "5", "Great product! The sizing is very correct and the shoe fits very comfortably.": "5", "I never saw sneakers as cute as these these Tom and Jerry's please make more": "5", "PERFECT SHOE, STYLISH AND PRICE EVEN BETTER. i AM FAN OF REEBOK": "5", "These are very nice and comfortable would recommend": "5", "I like Club C but they usually don't look good on my feet except for these": "5", "If you have somewhat wide feed these may not be as comfortable for you.

Stay young at heart!": "5", "My husband can't wait for another pair. He loves the dual color sole.": "5", "My grandson is a big Club C 85 guy.  I've bought him several pairs of them, and he likes them in all styles.  He requested the paper white shoes for Christmas, and they exceeded expectations.  Comfort, fit, and style all in one.  I can order his size knowing they'll fit correctly in both length and width.  They have good support, too.": "5", "Love me some Reebok  always a quality shoe, very comfortable to stand  in especially if you have a standing job.": "5", "Very comfortable shoes. Would recommend for anyone that love Tom and Jerry.

I'll be back!": "5", "The shoe is really nice but from the pictures I thought it would be all white with some faint calligraphy characters but those characters ended up being very pronounced on the shoe (which is fine just not my style).

Black is my favorite color!": "5", "Best shoes ever so comfortable and stylish!!! I have all colors": "5", "Great shoes, nice look with jeans or shorts.

Very comfortable and stylish.": "5", "I enjoy the  extra holes that allow you to make it a no-tie type of shoe you can slip on. The shoes feel comfortable  and fit the right length at the end of my toes. My only draw back is that my feet are more wider and less skinny so I may of needed to go up to 9.5 to adjust to the narrowness of the shoe.": "4", "Great quality..look clean and fit great would recommend": "5", "buying another pair right now! very comfortable, stylish and durable. the go with everything too bc they are super casual but minimalist enough to to dress up with and not distract from your whole vibe": "5", "the colors were so much brighter than expected!! Comfortable fit": "5", "Love these white shoes. Perfect everyday sneaker!  Would recommend sizing a half size down if possible.": "5", "This was not my first order and will certainly not be the last. These are great shoes, true to size. Thanks for being reliable.": "5", "I love these shoes so much! however if you're going from women's sizing to men's sizing, I'd say go 2 sizes down. for example i'm a US women's 8 but I bought a size 7 which were way too big, but after exchanging for a size 6, they fit perfectly!": "5", "Decent shoe to buy, would buy another pair in the future": "5", "I guess it's better than china tho lol. Quality was ok but I figured for the price, they'd be a lil more authentic.": "5", "product was wonderful would reccomend to anyone. Eric emanuel did a great job on these.": "5", "I have bought these shoes since 1986 and they are the best tennis shoes on the market..": "5", "This shoe is a whole meal. Nothing beats classic flavor.

They look really great.": "5", "True classics. At this price point, these are the highest quality sneakers I've ever had.": "5", "I wear these when I need to be on my feet all day, and they've yet to disappoint. They also look great and are easy to wear with many casual outfits.": "5", "The quality is a bit lower, on the inside some of the stitching looks like it may not last too long. But besides that, and I think they will last plenty long, they are great shows": "5", "These shoes are a best buy bargain.  They are great looking, comfortable and of excellent quality.I am 100% satisfied with the purchase.": "5", "The comfort this shoe has makes it worth it all on its own, but then you add the style and it brings it to a whole new level. 10/10": "5", "You call them vintage, but somethings don't go out of style.  Great quality, comfortable and just plain white, no green neon or blinking heels just plain white, getting hard to find.": "5", "These are great classic shoes that fit orthotics And are always consistent": "5", "A very stylish look, the vintage look of the shoe is very appealing.": "5", "These sneakers have that classic look and feel, and look great with every fit. I wish the bottom was closer in color to the leather for a more unified off white cream kind of look. Comfortable for casual use, but not the best if you're moving around a lot/at the gym. I'd give them a solid 7.5/10.": "4", "Fantastic shoes! Best shoes I've worn in a long time. I bike in a big city and comfortable shoes with support. These are perfect!": "5", "The right shoe created great discomfort to my foot.": "1", "you peoples  should go back to the old sole..................hankthe way you made the club just five years ago......please!!!!": "5", "These shoes look sick, are comfortable and fit true to size.": "5", "Been wearing this shoe since the eighties.

I hope you could produce the vintage one in Classic Leather aq9136 as well": "5", "Super good quality, would definitely buy it again!": "5", "Great shoes super comfortable and looks good. One thing about the sizing chart though. The chart recommended  I order a size 7 even though I wear a size 9 in other brands. I went with my normal size 9 and the fit is perfect.": "5", "These shoes are iconic, would definitely buy more from this brand.": "5", "Smooth looking shoes, great fit, great price. Just as pictured and described online!": "5", "Great shoe. Very comfortable and perfect fit for my feet. Quality material that doesn't get dirty very easily. I would get another pair.": "5", "Surprisingly comfortable from the moment you slip these on, they look and feel absolutely superb. A je ne sais quoi that I have never felt before in a pair of shoes. My  proudness and reverence for these kicks only increases with every wear, every crease, every step. A mainstay in my closet from here on out, provided they're perpetually available. Please Reebok, we beg of you.": "5", "Good quality cool color.  Would recommend this shoe to everyone.": "5", "these shoes may look like chinky filas but they're mad comfy and look clean af with flannels": "5", "I purchase the hot ones club c (now sold out) shoes are comfortable and easily go with any outfit.

Can be written with any outfit.": "5", "Really true to size, comfortable lifestyle shoe fir your everyday wear": "5", "No cap these are the best sneakers you will ever own. I've had mine going on a year now and they've held up almost like new after beating them up relentlessly. So comfortable and well constructed, these are a steal for the price. Super easy to clean and they age very well unlike a lot of other leather sneakers. I've gone through a number of other brands/silhouettes, and none compare to the Clubs. Don't even think twice, just cop these and put them on straight out of the box. Low key phenomenal skate shoes too.": "5", "Pretty cool kicks": "5", "I would recommend this shoe to anyone going for a fun, stylish, and vintage looking type of style to add to their wardrobe. The shoe is comfortable, spacious, and cushioned to where you feel like your slipping your feet into a house slipper. But it still maintains the elegance and sportiness you'd expect with a classic Reebok shoe like this. It creases something fierce after first wear and seems like it might fall apart on me within the first year but it's a great shoe while it lasts.": "5", "So comfortable. Don't even feel like they need to be broken in.": "5", "I purchased these iconic, multi-season sneakers to chum around in. I remembered seeing these when I was younger. They are very comfortable and the off-white sole camouflages dirt well, but cleans very easily. They easily match up with jeans, chinos, or shorts. The laces are a bit long in my opinion so I may or may not switch those out.": "5", "Very pleased with the purchase. Would purchase these shoes again.": "5", "The leather is on par with shoes that cost twice as much!!": "5", "best shoe u can get. it's literally perfect omg. it's fashionable AND comfortable. what more do u want\u2049\ufe0f": "5", "The tan color really does looks nice, the inside of the shoe feels amazing there's so much cushion. It feels like I'm walking on pillows. Definitely recommend.": "5", "Took a chance on these. Never owned Reebok's before. Thought these looked awesome on an ad and they look even better in person. The silhouette is the perfect old school look. The materials and leather are softer than what you typically get on new shoes and it allows for nice creases in the toe that add to the vintage look of the shoe. Also love the material inside the shoe which old school and is prone to getting lots of sock fuzz. Just really gives them the old school shoe vibe which is what you buy these for. My only request is that Reebok offer a wide width but of course they won't. 10/10 buy then now": "5", "The comfort and style in this shoe go hand in hand together! I have wider than normal feet so many other shoes that I have purchased in the past have mostly been a super tight fit width-wise even in half a size up but the Club C 85's fits comfortably and snug on my feet. I would definitely recommend this shoe for any of your casual needs and it can be incorporated into nearly any outfit.": "5", "I like the shoes. My only comment would be about the leather.. it looks like faux leather.. In the future you should stick with real leather! It's more durable.": "4", "These are my favorite pair right now. They are stylish and simple. I can  pair them with anything really.": "5", "Love everything about it except staring down makes me not like the width.": "4", "They are slightly narrow so I'd recommend going up 1/2 a size, but overall these shoes are quite comfortable.": "5", "I wear an eleven in Nikes.  Ordered these in an eleven as well and a bit too small.  I think an 11.5 would have been perfect.": "5", "I've been wearing these for a little over a week, and I can honestly say that these are the best shoes I've ever owned. They're comfortable, classic, and immediately upgrade any look that I'd usually wear with Converse. Can't recommend highly enough.": "5", "Really nice goes with anything  easy to style with any type of clothing": "5", "Love the shoes they are true to fit and look amazing! I want to get these in all the colors! Shout out to Finish Line and Reebok!": "5", "Very stylish shoe. It's my everyday shoe. I like it": "5", "I've been wanting these for a little while now and finally decided to buy them.Pricing is a bit more than I like paying for shoes, but they are good quality!Very comfortable and a nice vintage look.Pleased with my purchase.": "5", "Great shoe, looks even better on feet. My package arrived sooner than expected as well!": "5", "Well-constructed and timeless design. I love cream colored tennis sneakers and this fills the hole perfectly": "4", "Amazing purchase.

Cute and comfy  stylish and sun lives them tue to size": "5", "My son loved his gift! Put them on as soon as he opened his present.": "5", "I'd rate it a 5 star but the insides seemed a little worn out. The reebok logo on the sole was already fading. But besides that the rest of the shoe is high quality and very comfortable to wear.": "4", "Very comfortable and good quality leather. Look even better than I thought and can't go wrong with a classic look": "5", "I bought the c85 in black leather with white sole and loved them. After some debate, took a risk on chalk white leather and love them even more. And I get so many compliments. Old school style and soooo comfy. Highly recommend.": "5", "So comfy and versatile color goes with everything ..........": "5", "The shoes were very comfortable and esay fitting for me.": "5", "come on reebok make  these  classics  in wide 4E  like  you  have  in  the  past": "4", "Great materials and construction. Sleek yet detailed design. Fits like a glove but I am expecting it to loosen up over time and mold to my feet. I would recommend going either tts or a half size up": "5", "This is my 3rd pair and I absolutely love these sneakers. They are so comfy .": "5", "Great quality and comfort.  On point with size and will age great.": "5", "I enjoy these a lot. Defiantly gonna be purchasing more shoes like this.

A must have": "5", "Love them. Great classic look and the color is the original one from the 80s.": "5", "Just as shown, looks great! Great fit! Comfortable": "5", "The shoe looks great, is comfortable, and is great quality.": "5", "Very comfortable and I have worn these exact shoes for 30 years and love them.  One small item wish they came in a slightly wider width but over all they are A-1.  Keep making them.": "5", "A weird review here but I had to mention it. I am a size 11 in Nike Women, when seeing reviews for this shoe people complained it was too narrow and the size chart for women felt off so I went ahead and got the men's shoe in a size 10.5 and it was perfect. I should say its very comfortable and feels well built and fits my wide feet well. The shoe started creasing ASAP which was weird because the normal white ones don't crease as fast as these do but I'm keeping these. They pair well with a lot of outfits. I don't know why I never found these shoes before or else I'd have snagged them a long time back. I'm recommending this shoe to all my friends.": "5", "If you are in between two sizes, size down. I turned these into beaters because they are comfortable and pair well with almost everything.": "5", "They are all around nice shoes. They look just as good today as they did when I was a kid, I would recommend these classics to anyone with or without classic style.": "5", "Absolutely love Reebok products.

I could wear them all day and not notice- Happy with my purchase :)": "5", "Reebok, don't ever stop making the C85's, and give us more color options. These have easily become my favorite pair of shoes and will be buying many more pairs over the years.": "5", "Overall great with every fit.

They're by miles my favorite shoe.  They go with everything and the quality is amazing on the materials.  Looking forward to some new colors in the future!": "5", "Too narrow across the toes, uncomfortable side heel.  I could feel the outside heel seam.": "2", "These shoes are amazing and very throwback. I get a lot of compliments on the style! My only complaint is the outsole is a little brighter than the picture. The anti smudge outsole  actually works I don't have any smudge after 3 months of daily use.": "5", "I love these shoes, they're extremely comfortable and extremely stylish! Would purchase again!": "5", "These are the most comfortable, highest quality sneakers I have ever owned at this price.": "5", "Idk how I didn't want these before. Like years before. I love them, they go with everything.  TTS and if you're in between sizes, size down.": "5", "I'll be honest. When I first walked around in them, I felt a slight discomfort on the inside of the right sneaker and it showed when I took the sneakers off after coming home. For the first few days, there was a slightly visible red bump where my big toe sits. After weeks of wearing the shoes though, this loosens up. I also really love the comfortable insole. Comes in handy as I am always on my feet all day.": "5", "These are my second pair of Club C'sThey get more comfy and better looking as time goes on": "5", "It was for my best friend's birthday. reebok was always his dream shoes brand.

Flat shoes dont fit well for me": "3", "Great fit and love the fabric. I've never worn Reebok before so I didn't know what to expect. Love them so far.": "5", "I love the classic look and wearability with anything. I haven't had a pair since high school, so I was very excited to get another at such a good price. They're a tad narrow, but my right foot is slightly wider than my left so that's no mark against the shoes.": "5", "Everything is just perfect from size to color to fitting": "4", "Shoes came on time and were very comfortable. Very happy with the results.": "4", "Nice and comfortable and go with anything.

Why do you not make this shoe in wider sizes????": "1", "Beautiful color, nice cheap beater. Leather is good quality.": "4", "the shoes are very nice. easy to style. good for skating": "4", "very comfortable and fits snug but there is visible insulation on the walls of the shoe next to the tongue which, in my opinion, adds an unwanted yellow color toward the whole aesthetic of the shoe but that is a very minimal nit picky complaint. Overall a very solid shoe.": "4", "They look amazing in person. I received many compliments the first time I wore them.": "5", "It is wide enough to allow me to insert an orthotic brace I have to wear and feels great on my feet.": "5", "I love the clubs and always wanted a pair because I saw my friends wearing them. I love my shoes they are just what I wanted.": "5", "Totally what I like.

I took out the insole which I do with all my sneakers & replaced it with an orthotic sole.": "5", "The shoe was nice except that it had quite a few defects.

I have no idea when or why they resized them, but  10.5/D from 1985-2010 is certainly no more than a 10/B in 2020. If they felt the need to narrow the shoe by 1/2inch or more, then they need to make W/2E or X-Wide/4E actually available. I did have to buy a 10.5/4E a few years ago to get the same size as my previous pair of std C85, but figured with the Vintage they'd have used the original template. No more Reeboks without trying them on in-store. Buying/Shipping/Returning over and over or buying 4 pair and returning 3 is just too wasteful": "3", "I like it because if the design of different compared to other shoes": "4", "Great looking, a bit stiffI'm a trainerI max out at 4 hours in these": "5", "It looks wonderful.

It has everything you need .": "5", "Hey it's a Reebok and we expect quality. The inner padding seems harder to me as I've expected a softer cushioned feel in the shoes as in the past.

I wanted to like these shoes because they were a pair I had always wanted as a kid, but couldn't afford. I love the color way and the nostalgia is the only reason I'm rating this high. These are very average-to-below-average in every way. They are not comfortable at all. The Hexalite isn't really Hexalite, just decorative. The midsole foam is hard and cheap.

It is  def hard but isn't uncomfortable.First the looks. They are HOT.  Pun intended. Guessing these will get plenty of attention.The insole is memory foam which I'm not a big fan of. Not sure how that will be in long term wear but initially not bad. The sole is hard and the only way I can describe it is you know how nurses always wear clogs and they all say they're really comfortable? That's the best way I can describe them.The hexalite in the heal is a joke and is just for show. I wonder why they don't use the floatride on these like they do on the Zig Kinetica.They def fit true to size as I wear 9.5 and they have plenty of room in the toe box.Gotta say, I really like them so far. Upset I didn't get the instapump OG with boost from last year but I def will be purchasing more styles in the future.": "5", "I got my lady these and he loves them.

Easily slips on and off": "5", "This sneaker is extremely comfortable and surprisingly lightweight, a welcomed change from the pumps I grew up with.

My boyfriend was getting frustrated that he couldn't find any in stores. So I told him to check online. Ladies we all know how some men can be when it comes to actually looking for stuff. I let 2 weeks past before I decide to order them for him. The look on his face when I asked him to open the door and the FEDEX gave him the box. He stated what you done ordered now and I told him me some shoes. Well fast-forward later on that night while he was laying in the bed I came out the shower with the boots on. Even though they 3 sizes to big the look on his face at the boots was PRICELESS. He was jumping on the bed like a kid. In all it was well worth it though.\ud83d\ude05": "5", "This pair didn't fit as comfortably as my others. The fit is just a little too big.

After initial break-in period of 2 days they are extremely comfortable. I did purchase the replacement insoles because they are far superior to the ones included. The insoles are from Timberland too and improve being able to stand and walk in the boots all day long. I walk a good amount and need reliable footwear and these exceed that requirement. No doubt these will last me a long, long time. I usually go with hiking boots but decided for the traditional look of some Tim's. Could not be happier with my purchase!": "5", "Just used for every day life. Comfortable and durable": "5", "Solid boot but too big.

Live the water proof material": "5", "I usually wear my boots on days we have bad weather like if it's raining or snowing. It keeps my feet warm and dry from bad weather. It's a comfortable fit on my feet and wouldn't want any other brand than timberland boots on my feet.": "5", "These are the best boots ever. I really thought they wouldn't last through anything but they've been through rain, snow, mud, you name it. I needed another paid badly": "5", "These boots are comfortable, warm and great in the snow.These boots are a New York City Icon.": "5", "I bought the 6\" premium Rust Nubucks for my boyfriend and he loves them. I ordered a full size down (9.5 instead of his normal 10.5) and they fit great. Now I'm ordering a new pair of work boots for me!": "5", "My only problem with timberland itself is the price of the boot is a little on the steep side especially growing up wearing the boots since the nineties nothing is changed but the price and I think everything should stay original. But I also get its a business guy to make money but there never gonna not be body": "5", "Casual wear during cold weather months..": "5", "I wold boy this product again and again": "5", "I normally wear a US size 11 in shoes (occasionally 10.5 depending on the shoe). I bought the 6 inch Premium Timberland Boots in store and I tried on both a size 11 and a size 10.5 When I put on my normal size (11), it felt completely comfortable but when I walked I could tell it was too loose. I tried on the 10.5 and it felt better. It was still comfortable but it felt like I could walk better in it without it feeling like it would fall off my feet.I've now had mine for 5 months. I think the 10.5 is good enough for me, but if I recommend one thing to all potential buyers, it's: go down a full size, or at least a half size. Many people like to wear their Timbs loose and not tied tightly. With my 10.5, I have to actually tie the shoes (loopty-loop then pull and all) in order for the boots to feel snug to my feet. Although walking in them without the shoes tied does not have a significant risk of the boots falling off your feet, it still feels very loose.So in the future, I will purchase a full size down in Timberlands (meaning I will buy a size 10 in Timbs). If no full size down is available, then I'll go for a half size down since it is still satisfactory. I do not recommend buying your normal shoe size as it will feel comfortable when standing/sitting still, but when you walk, the boot will be very loose.I also recommend spraying your boots with Timberland's balm protector & water proofer to help extend the life of your boots to protect them from snow and water. If any salt gets on your boots, make sure you clean them so the salt doesn't sit in the boot for too long and end up damaging the material.----------------------TL;DR: Go for a full size down from your normal shoe size. If a full size down is not available, then go at least for a half size down. I wear a US size 11 in sneakers, and I bought a 10.5 in Timbs; however, a 10 in Timbs would likely be even better. Additionally, take care of your boots by cleaning them and spraying them with waterproofer.": "4", "Great boots always a fan of theses.

Turns out still too big.": "4", "I bought the \"Rust Nubuck\" as a gift for my friend. The color looked more like the \"Medium Brown\" than an orangish-brown that was shown in the picture. The pictures probably used some sort of warmth filter to make the boots look more appealing. Still good quality and my friend loved it, but I am still slightly disappointed in the color difference.PS: The three-day shipping took 6 days to arrive, but my review only reflects on the product itself. If I were to consider the fact that the gift arrived three days past the estimated delivery (supposed to arrive ON Valentine's Day), the overall shopping experience with this product would be more of a 2-star.": "3", "Great boots, go down a full size": "4", "I am a 10.5 in all my other shoes, but I ordered a 10.

Not much of a good selection if you wear a 14 in boots with Timbs. If it was I would try other boots. The boot fits me great nice width def not too narrow. Great color I have the Rust Nubuck that looks great with black green and a very light blue Jean. Doesn't provide much warmth so west a good pair of thick socks. It's for sure hard to put on due to their being no added grip or pull tag to the collar. Their definitely not built for long walks so be mindful of that as well.

They have kept me surprisingly warm with wool socks in the Boston winter and 10inch snowfall. They're not fully waterproof but I was absolutely fine even when I had to step through several inches of snow fully covering the shoe.

My job is mainly just walking around a warehouse and houses. I thought these being a good leather (and they are good leather) would last a while, but I was wrong. The upper is very much in good shape but where these boot fail is in the sole construction. The sole starter to peel off after only about three months of walking on them. Another thing to note is, the robber sole is very soft and will wear off very fast so keep that in mind. I wouldn't recommend these boots for any kind of work. These are for casual wear and to be stylish that's all, not very durable sole. I love Timberland boots and I will continue to buy them but I'll be careful about what I buy for work from now on.": "3", "Should come with noodle cleaning brush.": "5", "Thanks": "3", "Great product, no complaints for my child about any uncomfort and keep his feet warm": "4", "AMAZING PRODUCT": "5", "Was really difficult to get the sizing right but I love how comfortable these are + how good they look + how well they work!": "5", "They fit good": "4", "This is an everyday boot for sure! I can wear these with jeans or slacks and then are the perfect balance between casual and business with an edgy feel. Full leather uppers feels great. Not sure yet about the soles, really hoping they last. I can't tell yet, since I don't see any stitching coming through, I doubt they are goodyear welted construction or anything so I don't know how repairable they will be. Overall very happy with the boot.": "4", "I just love Timberland Boots": "5", "I wear these boots as a gardener and landscaper and love them.  I wear them until they disintegrate and I'm on a brand new pair now, breaking them in for the Spring.   My last pair survived four growing seasons of hard work, plus hikes, walks, etc. They're great boots!I wear a Ladies Size 6 and I purchase a Boys/Youth size 4.5 in these.  They're no nonsense work boots.": "5", "An outstanding boot by Timberland. And they're celebrating its 10th anniversary, well here's too many more. Comfortable right out of the box, with little to no break-in period. They do run large, as most timberland boots do, so sizing a half to a full size down is recommended. I myself went a full size down. What more to say,Stylish, stable, durable, comfortable, this boot delivers on every aspect. It holds it's own in these frigid Chicago winters and looks rugged in the spring/summer.": "5", "I was looking for a good, light, waterproof boot for the colder weathers for SoCal. These are great, but I didn't realize that they are in Men's size. I returned mine and reordered.": "4", "I love these boots only thing that I would say about them is that first break and you have to unless the entire boot and stretch it and it has two tabs on the side that get in the way of wearing the boots gotta push them on really hard but they look great": "4", "Color was not at all what is shown in the picture.

Looking boot just run big. Sent them back and will reorder smaller size": "5", "I ordered this based off the picture I saw over and over for the color style.  I was confused when I received these as the color style description was different than what I ordered.  However the style code was correct.  What I received was very different than the picture - instead of a fashionably worn look, this was a solid red leather boot.  I was really excited for the purchase, and when received I felt really let down and torn like I should keep the boot and see what happens...  but now I'm feeling like I need to return wasting weeks of my time.": "2", "I love everything about these boots!

It seems that Timberland's reputation as a fashionable and durable boot does not live up to the hype.

They look better in person than online and are really comfortable.  My only issue is that after a month of not wearing them that much, the cloth material on one of the tongues separated.  It very well could've been a fluke.  Other than that, these are great!": "2", "Great boots!": "5", "Used these shoes for work, I had them for about 2-3 months now and the bottom is balding, I walk about 4-8 miles a day, too narrow for size 12 men's.

I have my newest pair for church (seriously), the next newest pair for work, and the final pair for yard work, and running around training dogs. They hold up for a good amount of time, and they fit me perfectly, that's the big thing, not every shoe does, and these, with the help of an insole, healed my plantar fasciitis.The only knock I might have against these is the rubber toe wrap always peels away. It could also stand a bit more depth to the tread. Neither one of these will keep me from buying this shoe as long as they make them. They fit me.": "4", "I bought these both for hiking and for winter boots, I live in southeast Arkansas so we don't have much of a winter usually. But we just got 18 inches of snow, I wore them in the snow for over an hour and my feet stayed warm and dry the whole time! They're super comfortable, and they look good.

I liked these boots so much I bought a pair in dark brown, black and light brown. Although they are the same boot, they look totally different when worn.

Highly recommend.": "5", "I love this boot, the color, the style, the feel, everything about it.  The comfort is amazing, I wear them as work boots and have no problems at all.

I've had a breaking in period with these, the eyelet rivets at the top of the left boot and the very top of these boots have kind of hurt my feet. Not bad enough to not wear them. They scuff super easy but they're not dress shoes. Not sure if I would buy them again.": "4", "Very attractive, multi purpose boot. The color, however, is problematic. One boot appears visually darker than the other.": "4", "Very durable no water goes in so far so good": "5", "Great boot.": "5", "Product is advertised a waterproof. They are most certainly not waterproof. I would say they are water resistant. 3rd day of wearing them at work I had to step in a large puddle while getting out of my rig at work and both boots had water in them within seconds. The water line never reached the laces of the boot. Anyone that works in the elements will tell you wet feet will make your day miserable. Not recommend if you want your feet to stay warm and dry though out your day.": "1", "I work in many different environments and these bouts are perfect for all .

Apart from my initial review, where I said these boots were one full size larger than any of my other boots, nothing further to add. Good product. Thank you.": "5", "FYI.. With Timberland boots order .5 size bigger for best comfort, I think.  I inspected the boots out of the box, everything is as it should be.  Always loved Timberland quality and this one did not disappoint.  I live in north PA and it's January,  currently freezing rain.  Feet is warm and dry.  I need to break it in more but so far I like the comfort and feel while walking on uneven ground.  I would definitely buy this again.": "5", "Comfortable for hiking, warm and waterproof.": "5", "I buy these boots every 4 months for my partner. He has severe back issues. Timberlands are the only boot that gives him some relief at work. The heals wear down quickly and that is the only reason we replace them so often. So it's about  a $25 investment per month to allow him to work comfortably. I'll take it!": "5", "Love these boots but the inside materials on the right boot dug into my ankle. Would've kept them, they are really nice -stylish, sturdy, and comfy": "4", "Great quality, comfortable, warm!": "5", "I use these for hiking.

I'm an avid climber/hiker, and since 2018, these are the only boots I've used on trails. I've easily put hundreds of miles on these boots, and they're still going strong. I've hiked in everything from  knee high snow in the mountains, to dry summers in Joshua Tree NP, and they've held up through all the elements. If this pair ever wears out, I'm definitely buying another!": "5", "Great winter boot! Wore out the soles of my first pair after many years of use.

This is my fourth pair, and I'm equally impressed with the quality and lightweight feel of the product.  And, I was really happy with the actual color of the leather version once it arrived, thanks!": "5", "Good overall boot. The only negative is the attachment of the uppers to the sole.

I immediately ordered another pair of Timberland work boots so that I could wear the Mt Madssen for casual wear. Will be buying another pair for a backup just in case they discontinue this style...": "5", "Great for casual wear. May not be stable enough for hiking.": "4", "I've had several Timberland boots over the years, typically the 6\", but was looking for something a little more versatile.  These seem to be just as solid, but a little lighter and good for hiking or jobs that require a little more mobility.  Very comfortable so far (though I've only worn them once), and already being waterproof is huge for winters in New England.Only issue I have is that both boots came a little scuffed, and even the stuffing was just laid on top of them in the box (instead of inside the shoe).  The soles were still in perfect condition, so it doesn't appear they were really used, and not enough of an issue for me to exchange them.": "4", "Comfortable right out of the box. I really like the mid-high boot and the availability of the wide sizes. I use for everyday wear.": "5", "I am back to these after trying other brands.  i do a lot of dog walking in trails.  i also do facility work.  These are sturdy and comfortable and look great.": "5", "Fits well. I like the shoe": "5", "Super Shoe, I love them !": "5", "Wear with jeans, shorts, casual pants.

There was a series for snow and sunshine which meant snow slush, and mud and the boots performed amazingly. We hiked on and off for 5 days and my feet did not feel cold or tired at all. The boots a very comfortable and I absolutely love them.The boots were more brown (than tan as shown in the picture) out of the box, but after i wore them for a couple of days they got more tanned (not sure what is the science behind that).": "5", "I bought these because I needed a pair of boots for the fall and I am happy with the purchase.

He loves to hike and work in the yard.

I'll continue to buy Timberland products.": "5", "Most comfortable boots I've ever had.": "5", "Excellent product....": "4", "Very sturdy boot...bought 2 pair!": "5", "Like the boots alot but FedEx delivery is terrible. Fedex man said repeatedly he left package on door step but my security camera doesn't lie. Bottom line, FedEx's employee lied about delivery and got away with it.

I've worn them hiking a few times now and lived in them all of last weekend. They are in fact waterproof as advertised, but that makes them a little hot (duh). They are comfy, tighten up in the right places and I felt like a mountain goat on the high rocky trails we were on. The gray nubuck is a dust magnet but cleans up easily. I love them.": "5", "I wear these boots everyday. I am considering buying a second pair so that I have one pair for everyday use and one pair for when beat up work boots won't work for the occasion.": "5", "These boots are awesome, I normally buy 2 pair a year in black, but I saw the grey and loved the color the only negative comment I have is the grey only comes in wide width so they feel a little more roomy than my usual regular size 13..Please make this color in a regular size.A loyal Timberland customer!": "4", "I used these boots to hiking in Sedona and the Grand Canyon and they were AMAZING": "4", "Boots fit great and look great...

Wouldn't wear any others.": "5", "Using as general around the yard / light work boot.  I wear size 13 and fits true to size.  Reasonable amount of cushion in sole.": "5", "I bought these boots for work as my old boots that I have bought for years were discontinued. I only wore them for about a week before the rubber toe piece began peeling away from the shoe. I was unable to return the shoes because I didn't have a receipt. So I tried to get my moneys worth anyway, and after two months the shoes are tearing at the seams, lifting from the sole, and the rubber piece at the toe has peeled back. I am very disappointed in timberlands customer service and return policy. I was told that the seams were warrantied for a year, but only with a receipt. I understand this policy, but I had proof of purchase with a bank statement and they would not honor the return. Long story short... KEEP YOUR RECEIPT or go with a company that stands behind their product.": "5", "I would use the boot for work  and everyday wear.": "5", "I got this shoe as gift.

My reason for only two stars is that the tread on the soles of the boots wore out after only 3 months. I do use these for work as a groundskeeper and have put many miles on them but I had hoped to get at least a couple years of use from these boots. The leather uppers are still in good shape but they have become a safety issue on steep slopes because there isn't any tread left to prevent slipping.": "5", "Love these for work boots and they last a long time.": "5", "I love my does! They are a perfect fit.": "2", "Great, comfortable boot for hiking, working in the woods, and leisurely wearing.I wore these clearing out a disc golf course and they did wear out within a year.  They lost their waterproofing properties, but I  put them through extreme wearing and usage.": "5", "Received the box and could not believe how good looking this pair of boots is. And then I tried them on...perfect fit, size and width. Easy to slip in and comfy to wear. These are my only daily shoes ever since! My wife suggested that I change the laces to the red-colored ones, and boom, even better looking!": "5", "This is my second pair. First was the almost reddish brown color. The first pair lasted me a few years before the side stitching popped. I wear them as everyday work boots for the shipping industry and electrical work. They become extremely comfortable after you break the leather in.": "4", "Boots are very comfortable": "5", "I even put a little bit of mink oil on my pair to give them a little extra water repelling power.": "5", "Timberland is awesome stuff. These are really nice. They fit really well. I thought it was nice to get two pairs of laces. They came with the brown, but the red ones were in the box too. I am very happy. Shipping was fast. I am excited to have these boots. If the government would end all this coronavirus stupidity, I could go out and really enjoy life, and my new boots.

I'm happy to say that i agree. there was virtually no break-in period, they are as light as some sneakers i have, and very comfortable. shipping direct from timberland was quick,( i think within three days).": "5", "These boots are such an innovation of sneaker comfort with the protection to weather elements - to rough enough to handle construction work debris. Really have to try and see. Never a dissapointment.": "5", "I have been using this boot for work for the last several years. I think I am now on my sixth or seventh pair and have no reason to look for another brand. Waterproof and the sole holds up to hard daily wear.": "5", "Outstanding boot that I wear until the sole is gone - about 4 months and 1000 miles.  Good price, durable and the wide size fits my wide feet - not always true for other boots.": "1", "Bought one pair a while ago randomly and they immediately became my favorite work shoe..as a solar technician I spend a lot of time on roofs and in attics so I put lots of weird stress on boots. These held up great. Wore my first paid til the soles wore through and finally the waterproofing went away and the soles were flat so it was time to order more.": "5", "These are very light and comfortable. The waterproof is just an added benefit.I may go another color next time. Just for variety.I highly recommend.": "5", "Love these! Hiked over 2000 miles in my last pair.": "5", "He loves them. Says very comfortable and wears all day.": "5", "The only thing I would change is the little rubber toe piece on the front. mine peeled down about a quarter of an inch on both shoes. I fixed it with some shoe glue. So I would recommend timberland maybe make them a little lower so they don't rip off so easily. But the boot is beautiful, it fits great, and it's well-made. I love them.": "5", "I have been buying these boots for over 10 years great for hiking, work or every day wearing. Best in value": "5", "I use them for work, they're by far the most comfortable boot that I've ever owned. Top notch quality.": "5", "After checking online, I have selected 3 pairs of shoes from Timberland for my size of 7.  I wear 7 in size with Adidas, Rebook AICS etc. I used this pair of shoe for a walk to see  if it fits and comfortable. It started hurting my big toe and index toe. This is the same size but the shoes are bigger that other company shoes and I could not wear. So I returned all the three pairs. Yesterday this pair of shoe was returned back to me with a letter stating that they do not accept the return  if it is \"damaged, washed, altered or worn \".I have question to the company \" How do you know if it fits and is comfortable ? And do you still consider a quality shoe when it wears with one use ? I talked to the costumer service and the guy repeated the same thing. I asked him to find ways to get my money back and he said to donate or give to a friend. It is ridiculous. What is that 60 days return period ? Is it to keep in your home and return after 60 days ? This is the first time and  company I have seen who returned the product back to the costumer.I would still like to hear from them and take back their shoes and refund my money back.": "5", "Great boot , comfortable boot": "5", "Used them on a 4 hour hike.The good:The shoes have good grip. They look cool. The most good looking hiking boots I've seen. I stepped in a stream and the waterproofing held up. I've used them only once but they feel durable. Generally comfortable besides the two gripes below.The not so good:As a flat footed person, the insoles hurt my arches. However, this is the exact reason why I bought these shoes: I can simply switch out the insole for an orthopedic insole. Problem 1 solved. The second problem I ran into was when I hiked with these boots in 89 degree California weather. The shoes are not breathable and the inside of the boot gets like an oven. I now know the true importance of breathability. I mitigated this by wearing wool socks. It still gets really hot in these shoes. After these boots wear out I will opt for a more breathable option.": "5", "My husband uses them for working around the house as well as his job.": "5", "Bought for my son and he said they feel great": "1", "ITS GREAT...!!!": "5", "Great work shoes": "3", "comfortable and feels like a sneaker": "5", "Overall the shoes are great.

When I tried them on at home the right one felt a little tight. The foot bed, beneath the inner sole had been poorly constructed, it had ripples or bubble up in the toe area, making it smaller and uncomfortable.It's going to cost me $8.50 to return the defective boots and I still need boots. Quality control was non-existent on this pair and I wonder if it's any better on the rest.

I hate the laces, so I buy a good pair of black boot laces when I buy the boots. Typically, I go through two sets of laces before I need to replace the boots. I have never torn up or worn out the leather, it is the soles that I wear out. I have never looked into replacing the soles since these boots are very affordable.

Not giving it a second thought, I threw the box away: looks great, feel great, I had no reason to send them back.The next day I wore them to work. It had rained overnight, the ground was wet, with puddles in some places, and there was a light drizzle. I didn't care: my boots were waterproof!Not! When I got home from work that afternoon, I took the boots off and noticed that the thick light grey socks I wore that morning were darker around the toes, parts of the arch and the heel, on both feet. Whaat?? I had worn the boots all of my 10 hour day and never felt that my feet had been wet after the short walk to the car in the parking lot that morning. I should have read the description of the boots as 'mid waterproof ' . Ok, bad pun.Be that as it may, I really like the boots: they look great, are very comfortable and strong ( apparently).

The only issues is the the shoelaces, they are round and soft so they come untied during they day. I replaced them with a flat lace, they seem to be the way to go. I had them on my other pair. That first pair lasted me 3 years. I'm a construction superintendent, I'm on my feet constantly on concrete, dirt and mud, these work great. They are a boot and not 100% waterproof the only boot that is, is made of 100% rubber and your feet can't breath. Love these boots...": "5", "Finally about to order my size 15, thank you.": "5", "Very stable comfortable Boot.

I was looking a boot that looks identical to this one, that I have been buying for years, but it was not waterproof. Couldn't find them, but saw these. Thought, oh well l will give them a try. They were a little stiff out of the box, but soften up pretty fast. My other boots were broke in feeling right out the box. These have thicker padding around the ankles. They feel good around the ankles, however I wear a  particular pant I like with these boots that are not very open at the bottom, so they tend to sit on top of the padded ankle support more on these boots, than my other ones. Have not wore them in the rain yet, nor had them long to comment further.": "5", "I bought this same pair 12 years ago and only need a new pair after sitting too close to a campfire.

They have seen temperature extremes either way and many trails in Yellowstone and Glacier NP. The best feature are the lace hooks, for the middle of the night backpacking restroom treks. Easy on and off. Now living in Ohio they have held up to daily salt abuse in the winter. The original pair are finally showing some wear so I am looking for my second par now.

And  the right shoe causes me a red spot, so I need to tai it up very tight in order to avoid that happening.": "5", "zero functionality. you can't even lace these shoes.

Not sure why it was such an issue to get the right pair of shoes!": "3", "I love everything about the Nike Presto shoe!! The look, the comfort, and even the price. I did my research before buying and happy to say they are living up to what I read. They are so lightweight, it's like you're not wearing an athletic shoe.

I odered the shoes a little to small but was able to stretch them out with shoe trees and the liquid shoe stretch spray. Now they fit great . I can run comfortably in them. Now that I know my size is an s instead of xs I know how to order them now. I like them so much I ordered them in black. Nike is a great company and my favorite athletic shoes.": "4", "I'm a serious runner. I LOVE these shoes.

My foot is odd and this shoe enables a snug fit at the back and a nice wide fit on the front. The comfort is amazing . It fit my orthopedic inserts and I can barely feel my plantar faciitis! Also the sides of the sneaks do not cover the boney ankle area adding to the comfort! . I love the plastic type things on the side because they give added support for my arch area!": "5", "I bought this shoe because I had a pair years ago when they first came out and they were so comfortable.. They feel just as or even more comfortable than I remember!! It is a snug fit.. I wear a 9 in women's so I got a XXS and it's perfect!!!

Love them!": "5", "Haven't used it yet because I was thinking of sending them back, on the faux fur there's a spot where glue or something seems to have clumped up a good section of the fur, if it's on thing that bugs me it's a visibly flawed shoe.": "3", "Just to chill": "5", "The Blazers are one of my favorite shoes, and this Christmas pair is extra dope!": "5", "Love the Nordic blazer.

I would get a size bigger.": "4", "Great fit true to sizes , fast shipping": "5", "I got a great value on this thanks to Finish Line. The shoe runs a little snug so I'd recommend going half a size up if possible. It's also a bit heavier on your feet due to all the cushion and padding. They feel great for ankle support and change of direction especially if you're a guard that plays ball.": "5", "I purchased theses shoes to play basketball... I like how they fit .. very comfortable, there's not hi nag that I didn't like about them .. great buy": "5", "I recently purchased my son's 2nd pair of Nike's Kyrie 6 from the Finish Line site.

Now they're sold out of all sizes so I can't even exchange them.": "2", "These shoes are great for everyday use and they are extremely comfortable.": "5", "These are very stable shoes that are perfect for indoor and even outdoor ball. Warning if you buy any of the white colors though  the mesh, will get dirty very easily but other than aesthetics they hold up": "5", "The Kyrie 6 is just as comfortable as it's predecessors and the styling is definitely unique. The Zoom technology will have the fit snugly at first but breaks in after a few wears. If you have a wider foot you may want to go a half size up. The flap is a little short which causes it to buckle when connecting. That's the only change i would make on this shoe. Overall a great sneaker that you can't go wrong with.": "4", "cool shoe, fit comfortably": "4", "I picked up all my pairs from FNL so far!!   Kyrie 6 is a great shoe the best so far in his signature series.  It includes a great traction pattern on the sole.  Lockdown is amazing with the strap.

I would say to purchase a half size up. Shoe fits like a glove. Very comfortable.": "5", "The Kyrie 6 hands down has to be one of the best sneakers Nike basketball offers for a variety of reasons. The turbo cushion set up coupled with some amazing traction make the experience under foot amazing. They run narrow as most Kyrie's do however going a half size up should give you an perfect fit and the forefoot strap just adds even more containment. I have not one complaint about the shoe, it is for sure a sneaker you need multiples colorways of.": "5", "Good for casual wear but fit kind of tight": "2", "SO I HAD TO RETURN MY ORIGINAL PAIR BECAUSE OF SIZING, BUT QUICKLY REORDERED. THESE KYRIES R FRESH AND FULL OF FLAVOR...... I CANT WAIT TO THROW TOGETHER A LIL SUMIN SUMIN...... FINISH LINE IS THE BEST AND most QUILIFIED SNEAKER SPOT IN THE MALL AND ONLINE. VERY RELIABLE \ud83d\udc4d": "5", "I got the Kyrie 6 'Enlightenment' and they are perfect, just as the Kyrie 5's are (though, like past Kyrie models, they run 1/2 t0 a full size small; trust me: buy a 1/2 size up from what you normally wear in Nike). Not the biggest fan of the velcro stripe, but it doesn't interfere with the comfort any. I get all kinds of compliments on these (second only to my Kyrie 4 70's decade kicks). Can't go wrong with Kyries": "5", "My son pretty much love all of Kyrie's shoes. The grip is amazing and it's just all around a great basketball shoe.

I haven't played in them yet, cuz of the whole pandemic but I can't wait, they're very comfortable and nimble compared to my Lebrons.": "5", "The shoes didn't fit well for my foot size.": "3", "By far the best kyrie so far.": "5", "Brand new out the box the shoe fits very tight. It takes a few games to break them in.  After they are broken in the shoes fit great. They're built for quick cuts and slashes to the basket granted if your able to physically perform the moves. The shoes do not improve your basketball skills. Happy hooping": "4", "I still haven't breaked it in but so far, the traction is good. Only things i don't like so far is how hot it gets and the strap fraying the laces.": "4", "I use them every day, whether it is for basketball or for casually walking.": "5", "I had to buy this item a size up twice and it still didn't fit.": "1", "Great shoes.

My son has yet to wear his due to them running a half size small. The are nice shoes, I've received a lot of compliments on them. I wish the return/packaging slip was included in the box when it arrived, so they could be exchanged. Definitely order a half size larger.": "3", "MANY REVIEWER RECOMMENDED 1/2 SIZE UP. SO I BOUGHT 1/2 SIZE BIGGER THAN MY NORMAL SIZE. IT'S PERFECT FIT. THIS KYRIE 6 IS LOOKS VERY STYLISH AND VERY COMFORTABLE.": "5", "I have been wanting a pair of Kyrie's since his first signature shoe, and I finally got em. The shoe looks amazing and are really comfortable. Only problem is they are very narrow. I originally bought my true size 11 but they barely fit. I had to go a whole size up to wear them casually. If I played basketball in them I would recommend half size up because they are narrow and break in nicely.": "5", "These shoes are awesome stylish and comfortable, I surprised my son with new shoes and he loved these": "5", "Kyrie's shoes are one of the best performance basketball shoes and this one lives up to all his standards. As usual this shoe has great traction and is super responsive with the Air Zoom Turbo cushioning. The shoe fits true to size and is snug, as the past Kyrie models tend to be, especially with the mid-foot strap that give the shoe great support. This model also has great styling and comes with a lot of cool colorways. Great all-around basketball shoe out there!": "5", "I'm a fan of Kyrie, and his shoes. When I saw that they were on SALE plus 25%, I had to cop. Nuff said tho, glad I got my pair. Stay Safe and Wash Your Hands...#SemperFi": "4", "These are beautiful shoes. The details are intricate and thoughtful. The strap is useless and annoying - sticks to laces and tears them up if you're not careful.Common sizing tip with the 6's: These run a half-size small. I ordered true to size and my pinky toe was smashed into extreme discomfort. Returned and did half-size up and it's perfect!": "5", "He plays basketball and reviewed the reviews for the best sneakers to support his feet. These sneakers WON..": "5", "They look very appealing both on and off feet, fits comfortably. They are a good performer on the court with superb lateral and horizontal traction. They are good on an out door court with little frailing.": "4", "These run too small. I went 1 whole size larger than usual and they were still too tight. (I wear a size 10 with fairly narrow feet and a good arch). Maybe they need to be broken in. I just wish they fit like the Kyrie 5s.Pros: stylish, comfy, good tech in the midsoleCons: uncomfortably snug across toes and midfoot, velcro side of strap can shred the laces": "3", "The shoe is tight so I removed the insoles. That made a big difference with regards to the snug fit. Otherwise the shoe is comfortable. I feel like they run at least a half size smaller than the actual size.": "4", "I first bought the lebron 16 low size 10. They were a little big, and I sprained the same ankle twice in the same week. I decided to get a pair of highs, and went with these Kyries in a size 10. Im so glad i did. They fit so much better to size, and have not sprained an ankle since the switch. One of the better basketball shoes I have played in over my 30 years. Traction is fantastic, and the extra support with the strap is A+.

The tractions are amazing with rubber wraps around the outsole moving up to mid, good cushioning, top material is breathable but still well shielded.

I do have wide feet (D) but even I would highly recommend trying them before you by as half size up still needed time to break them in.

They're pretty much designed for cutting.": "3", "My favorite team is the Cleveland Cavaliers, and my favorite player is Kyrie and this year I think Nike did a great job on the deign this year, I have wanted to get basketball shoes for a long time and then I fell love with the Kyrie3's as soon as I put them on my feet for the first time, they don't get dirty easily, their durable, and they look amazing.": "5", "I'm a guard and has good traction but at the toe it curves which hits the 4th toe.the shoe has zero traction.": "4", "I got this shoe at $150 , I thought they would be comfortable to wear in public but I'm wrong.

I would recommend for any type of basketball performance.": "5", "When I saw the bloody swoosh on the inside tongue and the homage to Friday the 13th on the insoles I had to get them.

Like it's previous two predecessors, the shoe's upper composed of prime or battleknit provides a comfort to the foot that regular leather cannot provide, however unlike the 15th and 16th edition of the shoes, this shoe leaves nothing to be desired; I feel like this is the perfect culmination of 15-16. Aesthetically perfect and performance perfection. I love this shoe and have a few color ways.": "5", "Great style, the red is amazing. These are very comfortable!!!! We'll worth the money.": "5", "I wear a size 11 1/2 and when I did receive them they were very tight so I returned them for a size larger 12 1/2 and those fit pretty well so my opinion they seem to run small compared to my other shoes.

I highly recommend these shoes!": "5", "Bought the shoes for my high school aged son. Despite the color, he's able to match them with his wardrobe. He loves them!": "5", "Long time LeBron collector! pick up was a no brainer": "5", "Brought the shoes for my husband's birthday and he loves them. He stated they are very comfortable, has good cushion, and the color red is his favorite color. I would recommend this product to my friends and everyone else.": "5", "My son loves Lebrons shoes has every pair. Bought these for him to wear in his basketball games. Second time wearing them the little tag on upper shoe came off on both shoes. Very tight at first. Needs to make them a bit wider. Just very disappointed that we have sewn on tags coming off makes them less valuable and very disappointed since shoes are over 200.00.": "4", "Got these on release and immediately felt they were a bit too narrow/tight on the middle of my foot.

It is the most well put together shoe I've ever bought. I love it and want to buy more colors.": "5", "I normally don't write a review however I really value others opinion, So here is mine. I purchased my shoes online and received them a couple of weeks ago. I wear a 11 1/2 and these are really tight on my feet. I figured, hey let me break them in so they would loosen up. So I wear them at the gym, to work and anywhere else that would allow me to stretch them out more however there's still no change in comfort. The lesson: try them on at the store b4 you order them online.": "3", "The shoes are very nice BUT they are extremely tight width wise and are not stretching out at all.": "3", "Nice sneakers and feel good on the feet however they are a bit narrow or maybe I just need to loosen them up more.

They fit really snug so if you can, go up a half size.": "4", "This is a REALLY looking nice shoe in hand & on foot..It does fit a little snug on foot but my foot is narrow so it wasn't uncomfortable.. It probably would be a little uncomfortable for wider feet though!!": "3", "The color way and style are the reasons why I got these LeBrons. The size and air max build make them comfortable but they are narrow which does cause some discomfort to the side of my feet.": "3", "I use these to walk on create floors. I like the air and comfort.": "5", "I wear them and the shoes really stand out. The only issue I have is the bubble in the tongue of the shoe presses uncomfortably into the top of my foot. The simple fix was to loosen the shoe strings.": "4", "My husband loves the shoes, fits comfortably. He wears it to work, can stand & walks around all day without feeling any pain. No complaints. He loves his shoes!": "5", "This is my first pair of LeBron shoes, and I must say I absolutely love them. The fit is perfect, how they help stabilize my ankles when I'm walking.

The color in them is so nice and comfy also.": "4", "First, I like the look of the shoe and have gotten complements on them. Now, I find these shoes very stiff. I think the size is pretty normal. I prefer a softer feel, and find Adidas much more cushioned than Nikes. It took a good week to break these LeBrons in and the tongue is uncomfortable. I found very little cushioning, arch support or lateral support. I think these are fine for casual wear, but I don't recommend them for basketball. For this price, I expected a lot more.": "3", "I love the look of the shoe but the fitting is weird. I ordered my size and the entrance is so tight that less than half of my foot would go in. I exchanged and went a whole size larger.

Thanks so much": "5", "Ive been wearing Manoas for about 5 years now. I buy 2 pairs a year because Im afraid they will one day discontinue these boots (nothing lasts forever). I wear these boots all year around for work and off days unless its really hot out...they are very comfortable, light weight, water proof and still look good after a year of use.

They are definitely more of a snow boot than a work boot, but not conspicuously so. I do find my feet getting pretty toasty in them, but I think that would be the case with anything truly waterproof. These are much more comfortable to walk in than any snow or work boot I have ever worn, but they won't replace my casual shoes. Overall I'm very pleased.": "5", "I needed a new boot and these were on sale, similar look to tims, better comfort though. Great grip for snow/Ice fully functional and very comfortable.

I picked up boots this time around because after all these would be my \"work shoes.\" Totally worth it. Spend 8+ hours a day in them, walking around inside and outside. Excellent tread, comfort and stays true to how Nike's usually fit. Very comfortable for boots and not nearly as heavy as I expected.

Thanks": "4", "They are super light, but that is where the goodness ends. Trying to break them in but insoles are to flat. Wanted to put my own insoles in, but the ones in them are glued down.

I do not like that part but they are the lightest boots anyone has ever seen and are comfortable after you get them on. One huge thing though, these are NOT OIL RESISTANT!

Received someone else's order. Called customer service to correct the issue. They told me to return the incorrect order. Before they could send me the correct shoes. Wasn't happy about that arrangement.  Wanted the shoes for my son's Christmas. Returned the incorrect shoes. Called customer service with the tracking number. They assured me the correct shoes would be sent out. Would not get them in time for Christmas. Better late than never. WRONG. A week and a half later I received an email telling me my order had been canceled. And that I would receive a refund in 7 days. Not happy at all extremely frustrated.  After waiting nine days. Still no refund. Called customer service again. After the email I received clearly stated my refund had been processed. They then told me they could not process it until I called them. Terrible customer service. Done with Finish Line.": "1", "Shoes are great quality, very comfortable fit, stylish. My son loves them.

I'm a 11, but got a 12 and it was still tight, I couldn't go more than 20 mins without feeling cramped...

Almost 2-3 sizes small as a size 10 feels like an effervescent squeeze around the bridge and top of the foot. The shoe \"zips\" and over cradles your foot when placing it on. I'd recommend ordering a size or two sizes bigger than your true size to fit comfortably. You could \"force\" your foot into these shoes but if you're responsible about your well being I wouldn't recommend it. Disappointing purchase I took to finish line and immediately exchanged them for Lebron Witness V's. I would buy them again but they didn't have my size at the store that would fit the small fit.": "2", "I love the fit and easy to put on": "5", "wear them when I workout very confortable": "5", "Love them but would get a bigger size. these shoes run small.": "5", "Great for basketball and comfort !": "5", "Shoes are very comfortable and good price.
