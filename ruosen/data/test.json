One i love the top of the toe strap for support and also how the design of the shoe keep you on your toes. The 3's i wasnt that big of a fan support wasnt there and the insoles felt like you were almost running bare foot. Now The 4's All though they look sleek almost like the throwback Gloves.... the insoles and the Achilles area very padded and rightfully so after all the injuries or the past few years.

Will definitely buy again!": "5 ", "Fits good but just slightly tighter then expected but overall its very comfortable": "4 ", "I love these sliders!  They go with everything :-)": "5 ", "These slides are so easy to wear and comfortable. I was worried that they wouldn't be the right size as i tend to be between sixes but they were spot on!!

It fits a little better.": "3 ", "These are a beautiful color and super comfortable. I have gotten so many compliments on them. I have higher arches and still fit super well and give me the right support.": "5 ", "The only caveat I found for these shoes is that usually I'm a 7.5, and on the website it lists a Women's 7.5 size, but when I ordered the 7.5 it was actually a women's size 7. So I sized up for the Women's 8.5 (listed on the website), and I received a women's size 8 shoe. This worked out perfectly, but it's a little big. Just be aware these slides don't seem to come in half sizes! Love them all the same!": "5 ", "Everything from the comfort, design, logo and colour seems balanced. I love it": "5 ", "Really nice looking and fun slides. Love the color, the white looks so nice with the pink.": "5 ", "I got the 7M/8.5W because I wear a 8.5-9W, but these are so tight. The width of my foot is normal so I find these to be very uncomfortable just because the slides are narrow. If I had sized up, I'm sure the slides would have fit just fine.

Definitely my favorite slides.": "5 ", "Comfortable and lightweight. I was unsure about the camo but it looks really good.": "5 ", "This is my 1st pair of actual \"slides\" as I've worn \"slippers\" indoors previously. I like the design as I didn't want the name plastered in bold on the face of them as the logo itself is fine by me. My only gripe is that it felt narrow as I normally go a size up just in case but it was not a major issue to warrant a return/exchange. I'm enjoying them now, actually. No regrets.": "4 ", "Very comfortable slides.i would definitely recommend them.strong material.and u definitely cannot beat the price": "5 ", "Overall I am disappointed.

But the reason why I'm complaining is because they were built with people with skinny feet in mind and not an athlete. Maybe I purchased the wrong sandal but these are way to narrate for an athlete who might have swollen feet. I purchased a 10 but wish I got an 11. Overall great sandal though": "3 ", "The strap portion is slightly tight but think it's going form and loosen up after breaking in.": "4 ", "Comfort and style they match a lot of things I have easy to put in and off": "5 ", "Overall a grest a lide and waterproof would buy another pair.": "5 ", "Comfortable and I like the pink and white color combination": "5 ", "I like the reebok logo. well made product. price is a little on the high side": "5 ", "Nice looking shoes I enjoy them very interesting l will get more": "5 ", "Omgggg these are the best slides everrrr they feelLike marshmallows i need every color!": "5 ", "Just not really that comfortable.

And plus I'm a collector": "5 ", "These guys are staples.  Made for a typical size foot which mine is not since my arch is longer so I have to wear them at a pitch almost.  Its nice because they end up massaging my foot when I walk so there's that.  Can't beat the price point so I got one in each size.": "4 ", "I normally wear 10.5 in standard width and I have a normal arch.  I purchased the size 11 and they were a good length.  However, it felt like you had to jam your feet in as the strap is tight across the entire foot.  I figured they might stretch out so I wore them for the day.  They started rubbing my pinky toe to the point where I got a blister.  Good quality but beware if you have anything equal to or above a normal size foot in width or height.": "3 ", "I wear these as my house shoes and when I'm too lazy to put on shoes .

Another slept on classic collab. All the little details elevate the shoe above the average collab. Nothing is overstated, and on first look one might not even recognize them as a Tom and Jerry shoe.

Over all a perfect custom!": "5 ", "I bought this pair of Club C 85 with the Zig Kinetica Pride shoes together and love both of them. The Zig Kinetica Pride is no longer available so I'm just writing the reviews here. First of all, they both fit just about perfect and true to size.  Obviously, they look great and my biggest dilemma is which pair to wear most of the time. The colors are vibrant just like the pictures here.   I wear the Club C for day to day walking and the Zig Kinetica at work (I'm an ER nurse so really rough on shoes).  They are both comfortable though I personally prefer the Zig Kinetica over the Club C.  Top of the Club C feels a little tight so I typically try not to tie it too tight and then it's ok.

Unlike other shoes my feet weren't hot. I was hesitant because they were unsex but I'm glad I got them.": "5 ", "Great comfort and look. I get asked about them when I wear them out. They feel like they make you want to go.": "5 ", "The shoe does not compare to the other zigs. I have been wearing zigs for a few years and this one is my least favorite.": "3 ", "Great comfort and feel.  Extremely Light!": "5 ", "Don't let the lack of a squeak fool you, but the traction of this shoe on the basketball court is AMAZING. The cushioning is also super comfortable. Based on prev reviews, I did order a size up cause they run a little small, and it fit me well. (I normally wear a size 9, but got a 9.5) That being said, my toes did hit the front of the shoe box often and it hurt pretty bad. I think it's a mixture of the fact that the traction is so good combined with the comfortable, yet flexible shoe material that didn't really hold my foot in place when stopping. I've had several friends praise this shoe and love it, but it just wasn't for me.": "4 ", "The shoes are comfortable  but kind hard putting on and off other than that a nice shoe.": "3 ", "Best Currys so far. Great look, snug, solid traction. 100% happy with this purchase": "5 ", "Very comfortable and supportive": "5 ", "Daughter uses during high school basketball season. What a great, comfortable shoe. Lots of stick to the ground, nice cushion and plenty of style to go around. Best curry shoe to date!Delivery was excellent from finishline and tracking super helpful.": "5 ", "I play basketball a few times a week. To date, I have only used Curry's as they work great with ankle braces. When I received the 8's the color was great and the comfort was out of this world. But when it comes to traction on the court I found that I was getting good traction on hard stops or quick cuts, but when it came to just running around I felt my feet slipping consistently. The foam base is an awesome idea for weight but it does not compare traction wise when it comes to rubber.": "2 ", "This is the most comfortable basketball shoe on the planet. I messed around and bought another pair of Curry 8's after wearing these. Very satisfied customer and baller.": "5 ", "These are some of the best looking and best performing basketball shoes I've ever owned. The traction is great, the cushion is solid, and I like how the toe box is wider than most hoop shoes. Since they look like running shoes, you could wear them anywhere. Overall, a great shoe.": "5 ", "Amazing traction, good support, looks cool": "5 ", "My son loves the comfort of the Curry 8s when he plays basketball. He also loves the style. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.": "5 ", "For such expensive shoes, the fabric was not cut well and overall did not seem the highest quality construction. Additionally, I had to return them as the fit was extremely narrow and small, did not work at all.": "2 ", "I've loved the last several Curry models. I like that they're a little wide in the toe and have had a lot of heel support. I mostly where them in casual settings.": "5 ", "I liked how the shoes are lightweight. I also liked the grip the shoes had on the court.": "5 ", "Best basketball shoe I've work. Put away my Protro 5's for there.": "5 ", "This shoe looks good and very comfortable. It is also light and bouncy. True to size for narrow feet. If you have wide feet just try to add half size.": "5 ", "Very nice shoes and comfortable": "5 ", "Good for a guard since it low to the ground and the grip is excellent.  Enough cushioning to be comfortable and stable.  May not be good for a heavier person and may not be good for outside courts.": "4 ", "I use these to play basketball and it's simply the best shoe I've played in. No breakin period, fits like a glove and the bite is amazing even on dusty floors. I'm athletic so the fact that it has great floor impact protection makes it my favorite shoe.": "5 ", "Great shoe, the best shoe I have ever used to play basketball in.": "5 ", "I love the style and color they are eye catching": "5 ", "My son loves these shoes because they give him bounce.": "4 ", "Strongly recommend": "5 ", "I have always been a fan of Nike, Asics, Mixuno and Puma and these are my first Under Atmour shoes and I am super happy to have bought them because they are of very high quality, I would definitely buy tennis from this brand again and of course in Finish Line": "5 ", "Love the shoes been wearing Project Rock shoes since the PR2 dropped and haven't looked back. I was very excited when I saw you guys were carrying them!!": "5 ", "Bought these for my husband because he already had 2 pairs and he loves the color.": "5 ", "I love it. Fits perfectly": "5 ", "This is a very unique shoe": "5 ", "The shoes run true to size. I love the colors": "5 ", "Would have loved to wear, but they were wayyyyyyyyyy too big. Had to return.  Might reorder especially if I win the 100.00 gift card.": "5 ", "Purchased these to wear to a sneaker ball. I LOVE them. I have definitely been showing them off to everyone!": "5 ", "I tried to like the sneaker I will be returning these sneakers for the second time": "2 ", "I bought these because I liked the color and I think girls are awesome as well.": "5 ", "My favorite shoe, but the tongue of the shoe a little big. I don't like it! I might send them back and get the low top. Hopefully they better": "4 ", "You need these. It wasn't love at first sight, but I bought them because of the back story and because - girls ARE awesome - but now that I have them in hand, I'm in love with the details. The colorway. The silhouette. Everything is dope. They are the perfect mix of ol' school flava with new school attitude and they look even better in person. And for the reviewer before me, you don't have to BE a girl to know and accept that girls are awesome. So yes, it's plastered all over the shoe, but that's part of its charm. Don't sleep on these!": "5 ", "how is it gonna say Unisex then plaster \"girls are awesome\" all over them?....kinda dumb IMO....i woulda copped these for sure otherwise, they fire": "3 ", "This product is nice but it's cut very small. You may need to purchase a size up.": "3 ", "Love the look and it feels like I'm walking on clouds. I wear more for \"fashion\" so can't comment on how they do for sport activities but great \"errand\" shoes.": "5 ", "The straps are slightly tight but I think it's overall a good shoe, I'd say it runs true to size. I like shoes I can wear without socks sometimes and these don't make my feet sweat like other sandals, also I can wear them all day and they are still comfy": "4 ", "The most comfortable and extremely lightweight sandals you will ever find. Quality is amazing and I would get them in all colors if they restocked!": "5 ", "The top straps look like they are adjustable but they're not.": "3 ", "Bought a month ago.   With some lower back issues, been looking for a sandal with more cushion.   This is an incredibly cushioned sandal and extremely comfortable.": "5 ", "These sandals are so life changing. I bought them and was away from home on vacation. When I got back three weeks later I threw these on to test them. When I tell you I have worn them every day for the past two weeks I mean that from the soul. These are the most amazing sandals I've ever owned. The comfort level is sooooooooooooooooo amazing and still sturdy to keep you feeling as if your wearing a sneaker!These things really keep your feet feeling comfy, after a couple days wearing them the size to you better. As it is with all shoes since forever. LolThe Gel-Bondals are off the chains and still amazing not only to wear but to get continuous complements in. I really love these shoes/sandals I'm going to buy another pair for myself and one for my younger brother when I get paid next. I'm gonna be the unofficial model and spokesman for these I swear. LolFor an uplifting feel to your quarantine time and in-house chores or daily walks and hikes these are solid for all trust me!": "5 ", "This is a comfortable sandal. I wear a wide (2E) shoe and was hoping that these would work out for me.  They do not have adjustable straps going across the forefoot so it is a tight fit for the a bit after first putting them on, but they do seem to stretch out a bit. I can wear these for quite awhile without too much discomfort.": "4 ", "They are so comfortable.  I absolutely love them. I usually wear an 8.5. I got an 8 and they feel great. IExceptional heal supoort for a sandal. Plus they actually sporty cute. Nice change from wearing Asics sneakers.": "5 ", "Super comfortable and wear them for my daily walking!": "5 ", "Very comfortable!  However, I thought the adjustments were also over the toe and top of the foot area.  Not sure what the loops on top of those straps are for.  To hold a pencil?  Fit is perfect!  I bought the size 6 and normally I wear between a 6.5 to 7.": "4 ", "In general it's good walking sandalsIt's very lightweight. What it's needs a bit more arch support. Also when whether is hot it's get hot inside sandals too.": "4 ", "These are so comfortable based on my try on, however I need to size up.  Unfortunately they are out of stock in my size. :( .  Add more stock for 9.5 woman size.": "4 ", "Love wearing them around the house and outside on nice days": "5 ", "Wear as casual and doing the spring/summer": "5 ", "Love the comfort in these! A little tight but not too bad. If you like your slides to be bigger I'd order a size up!": "5 ", "Super small. Size up because they are not true to size at all.": "1 ", "Wish they came bigger or half sizes.": "4 ", "Sizing sucks. If you plan on buying please buy a size or 2 bigger because they run small.": "3 ", "Love the style and fit": "5 ", "I was so excited to buy these. Love that the colors are so vibrant but unfortunately they run small. I'm a size 7 so i bought a 7 but my heel overlaps a little. They don't have half sizes so I'm scared to buy a size 8 and they will be way too big.": "2 ", "Great looking and fast delivery!": "5 ", "My wife loves these slides. She said they are very comfortable and loves how they look. They were a tad tight on top at first but didn't take long to loosen up.": "5 ", "They are comfortable to wear all day, got tons of compliments and the colors are super fun and girly!": "5 ", "Really cute, but order up a size...super tight.": "4 ", "The women size 10 is actually more of a size 8 . They were to small . Yes , it's hard to rate . They are nice and cool looking, but don't fit.": "3 ", "At first since they are a rubber material they will leave a blister . And they run small I'd say I sized up I'm normally a size women's 7.5 but I sizes up to an 8 and I feel like I could have gotten away with a 8 1/2 . Very sturdy . Made good. Look great!!": "4 ", "I bought this pair and another color and even sized up. My foot wouldn't go in past my toes! These shoes run extremely small even when you size up! I ended up giving them to my daughter who's foot is a whole size smaller than mine and she could fit them, just barely.": "1 ", "I loved the color and I wear a women's 9 and a men's 8. My toes were the only part I could get in and I ordered a size up! Fitting was way off!": "3 ", "Great Slides!!": "5 ", "these are litterally the best slides i have ever worn in my life!!!!": "5 ", "I love the color of the slides but they are so narrow that I have a very hard time putting them on. Also that are awfully small for a women's size 8. Maybe you all should offer them in a mens size because I have the Champion M&M's slides in a mens size 8 and they fit great. No troubles getting them on.": "1 ", "I like the colors very true the picture!! Lots of complements and asking me where I got them from...feel like I should get thee other two colors! My only issue which is probably move personal, is I should have gotten a 9 instead of an 8 because they don't go up half sizes. Overall satisfied with my purchase!": "5 ", "I bought these in a size 10 in womens. When I tried to put them on the strap over your foot is very TIGHT. I dont have fat feet just big. They need to loosen the strap just a bit other than that the shoes are really cute.

A lil more green than I expected but I like em! I wear an 8.5 and got a 9. And they're a perfect fit. The strap across is quite snug.

Blue is her favorite color so to mix it with purple wit the tie dye setting it's lit!": "5 ", "Nice slides. My daughter loved the tie dye. They run very small though.

Gotta watch champion from now on apparently!": "1 ", "I bought them as a gift and she loves it.She wears them anywhere and everywhere.The slides aren't as cushiony but they're better in my opinion.
