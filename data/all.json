The style is nice. The shoe is very comfortable and not to heavy. Love this shoe.": "5", "This is the perfect shoe if you like basketball.": "5", "A classic had them back in highschool in white. I was hoping for a long time that they'd re-release.The low to court feel of them is unmatched with stellar ankle support that conforms to your ankle and doesn't constrict your ankle it's like a low top with a slight ankle support!Easily top 3 shoes I've ever worn for basketball!And I buy a lot lol": "5", "These shoes have always been super comfy. Very light shoe.The ankle wrap just adds reassurance. That's why it was easy choice for me. I've had bad ankles. Never did I ever roll ankles and these. So if you guys are looking for retro Adidas shoe, these are by far the top shoes.": "5", "I've always wanted high tops and I love the colors and how they fit.": "5", "I took the advice of others of getting a half a size smaller. I highly recommend to do the same and the shoe will fit perfect.

They fit great": "5", "I like the feeling of the shoe and it goes by your true size.": "5", "I ordered half a size down and they are still too big, came off my heels when I went for a layup. But website makes it easy to do size exchanges. I would suggest ordering a whole size down from your usual.  Even being too big, I found the shoes comfortable, and they seem to be good quality.": "4", "The colors on this shoe is amazing and should spread these colors to other shoe styles": "5", "I love the shoe but it's too big. I may not understand your sizing system": "5", "Love them wish i would of got them sooner but happy to have now ... looking forward to buying another pair different color .": "5", "Can't say enough about these, I already have two pairs and might get a third.

Fit and form just feels secure and comfortable.Fan": "4", "Hot pink with the light pink so fire abd it is light on my feet always wanted a adizero there mad comfy and being the d rose is special": "5", "The shoes are horrendous to move in. They run about a size too large and it's difficult to even walk in them with how bulky they are not even considering size. They look cool, but don't do any athletic activity in them.": "2", "They look great but they stole all my ACLs. Really tore up my knees hella bad.": "3", "So my son ended up telling me the wrong size so I ended up getting him another pair but I kept the ones he couldn't fit and I like them very much. Very comfortable just a half inch to big but they are great!": "5", "Good support around the ankles. The design is great.": "5", "Runs half size large, as usual with Adidas, but the quality is great and shoe looks even better in hand.": "5", "They are pretty comfortable and grippy they also make good shoes for guards and SF but not great for bigs": "4", "somewhat snug but it is a basketball shoe. Probably would go a size": "4", "Definitely great BB short for indoor and outdoor. It is a wide shoe that is very comfortable.": "5", "These are excellent shoes I would recommend to anyone": "5", "Many compliments.You will not be disappointed. The color is an eye catcher": "5", "I opened the box and the shoes sung to me. I showed them to my girlfriend and she got a little jelly wishing she had a pair to wear as well. Maybe I'll surprise her if/when her size is a available so we can match. Quite simply, these kicks are a lovely work of art.": "5", "I really like hooping in D Roses. They're very light and comfortable": "3", "The shoe itself looks very nice, I got the pink ones.

As soon as it was delivered to our house he wore them right away and kept complimenting how awesome they feel on his feet.": "5", "Unique colors and style.  Very light and comfortable shoes.": "5", "Stable shoe, lightweight materials and more than adequate support. I have the glow pink pair and use them strictly as hoop shoes on an indoor court. Material structure of the shoe is top notch which proves that even though it's a lightweight shoe, you will get good durability in an ultra modern basketball shoe. The rubber outsole picks up dust more than my DON issue 2's...also there's notable wear to the outsold after even the first 2 hour training in them. If you are a serious hooper these shoes will do the trick but will not last longer than 5-6 months if it's your only hoop shoe and you are in the gym countless times per week! Thumbs up for this shoe. I'd buy another pair without hesitation.": "5", "I was looking for little wider fit in a shoe. This was perfect.": "4", "The quality is really good and stable the comfort isnt the best but its better than average": "5", "Very nice shoes I thought they were a little bit bulky when I first got them but I put them on and forgot all about it real quick and ordered another pair right away because of how comfortable they are looking forward to get the Phoenix Reborn if they get in stock": "5", "Comfortable shoe that delivers great support both on and off the court.": "5", "Made In China Colorway for the win!Still look and feel great.

Kinda disappointed with the 8-10 but man, these 11's are fire!  It feels similar to my next level basketball shoes, but in this case with laces.  Love these shoes, so comfortable and squishy, and materials are very nice.  Will be getting a different color way for sure!!": "5", "A little wide but real comfortable. Look really nice.": "5", "They are stylish, comfortable, easy to wear, and a perfect fit. Only slight issue is the height of the shoe makes it a little bulky": "5", "If your reading this just buy it!!! 10/10 very comfortable": "5", "Finally a basketball shoe that is made for wide feet. Recommend ordering a half size down though. I love the look, fit, and feel of this shoe so much-I originally bought the Brendas, then I ordered the \"family first\" and a the new black&gold color way.  D Rose 11's are fire!": "5", "These were very tight on my feet. I had to return them": "2", "Very nice shoe, with attractive colors that can be worn with many different items. Super comfortable.": "4", "Very comfortable shoes, they ran a bit bigger than normal size 9.5s but with a shoe insole it was a perfect fit. 9/10 would recommend.": "5", "These shoes look awesome and I love how unique they are! They are also very comfortable. I highly recommend these!": "5", "The shoes style and design is good.  The materials used could be of a better quality.

I'm so glad I purchased them.": "5", "I love this, perfect size,  very comfortable and very good quality, high recommended.": "5", "My son is 12 years old and loves the shoes. I have struggled to keep them clean, but that has to do with my son's age and not the shoes. They were comfortable right out of the box. He has received many compliments, and that says a lot for being in middle school.": "5", "Fits well as I have wider feet, has great grip for racquetball courts": "5", "Fit perfect. Great arch support. Colors are awesome up close and look amazing.": "5", "Every where I go people stare at my shoes or give me compliments on how beautiful the shoes look. Just a amazing feeling and very comfortable feeling when you know people are looking down at your feet because you have something  Unique on.": "5", "Adidas is my thing....very versatile. Always looks great on me": "5", "The extra width to the sole bottom provides incredible stability.

Very comfortable shoe with great support.  5 stars": "5", "These are absolutely incredible shoes. I have owned many different basketball shoes and these are definitely my favorite. I do wish they would have kept the piece on the side of the shoe as gold instead of black.": "5", "The shoe is a perfect mix of comfort and style. My son absolutely enjoys playing ball in these shoes and the color coordinates with his uniform perfectly. He started out in DRose shoes and he's happy he found his way back to them. I would definitely recommend!!!!": "5", "I'm a huge DRose fan, these shoes are great to hoop in!": "5", "Nice better than most d roses out i have 5 different pair": "4", "They look even better in person. I was so glad my size poped back in to stock!": "5", "Looks better in person good quality great fit I love the design": "5", "my friend love it definitly will order more its nice and comfortable": "5", "The quality is very good and my shoe fits perfectly.": "5", "These are good quality shoes and well worth the investment": "5", "Nice looking shoe.

Instant comfort": "5", "I was so excited for the release of the Chinese New Year inspiration sneakers, but it was nothing like the pictures on the website. The metallics gold midsole lightstrike bar, which was the highlight of the shoes, is all black instead. It's such a disappointment.": "1", "Been wearing D Rose's since they came out. Comfortable, lightweight, great quality basketball shoe!": "5", "Will buy again ASAP. Great color way. Awesome shoe in 2021.": "5", "Nice shoes could use a little more arch support other than that they are comfortable": "5", "I never know which adidas shoe is based on a man's foot so sizing has become a big issue. I had to get a 7 in a running shoe when I bought my first boost shoe. Loved it except for the slippery sole. But over the years, I have had issues finding the right size and can never tell if the shoe was created with a woman's foot profile or a man's until it arrives. When based on a man's it is too long and narrow at the fore foot area for my foot. And too many shoes are being made 'sock' style with an attached tongue. I have high arches and this causes issues. Please note that this shoe has a detached tongue and that was why I gave it a try. It would have been a good shoe if it had not been made in a generic footbed and was based on a women's foot.": "3", "The grip is good. I started play with the shoe and  satisfied": "5", "I would recommend going down a size the run big, but very colorful and nice shoes very comfortable.": "5", "I've seen a few model of the D Rose line that I've liked over the years, but the 11 is by far my favorite! I really like the lightstrike foam although not as comfortable as the boost, but still feels pretty good under foot. The length fits great even though the width has a bit of space. Overall I'm very pleased with this shoes so much that so far I have two pairs and will definitely buy more colorways!": "5", "Great fit and comfortable. Looking forward to playing in them this season": "4", "Never order shoes online, but I tried and they fit perfectly and we're what I wanted": "5", "Great shoes but hey dont have gold plastic heel side foot piece , its in black....": "4", "Amazing  product best shoes ever confortable and great desing": "5", "Where the gold metallic is in the picture I did not receive on my pair of d'rose 11s. Won't recommend basketball shoes from adidas.": "1", "The Gold \"Lightstrike\" mid-sole Bar ended up being ALL Black on the shoe and took away much of the appeal the Chinese New Year version seemed to have. Once again. Perfect fit & very comfortable shoe, but it is not the shoe pictured and advertised above. I received a Red & Black Shoe w/ minimal gold accents only on the Tongue.": "1", "I'm originally a wearer of another popular brand but since I've experienced Adidas, I have found a new sneaker.": "5", "Wrong description I guess gold doesn't exist . But same art no.": "5", "Nice. Very comfortable and stylish. Was hard to find the red but once it was in-stock it arrived in no time": "5", "I bought these for basketball use. I love the design and the way they look - so much so that I didn't wear them for a while to protect the brand new look. They fit perfectly. My feet feel secure and supported during intense playing. Reviews also said to go a half size down and that was the right choice for sure.": "5", "Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing": "5", "You can definitely see some of the adhesive in some places.

I believe the quality will make this a long last shoe.": "4", "Perfect fit. I've been battling with some sneakers about the sizes. I'm an 11 and ultimately I've been buying shoe \u00bd to 1 size bigger cause it doesn't fit. But this one's are just perfect fit at 11. Love them.": "5", "Beautiful shoe, waiting for my size to come in to purchase in the other colors.": "5", "Super light and fit perfectly around my whole foot. I'm thinking of what other color way to get next.": "5", "It is a really good shoe I like what it looks like": "4", "Comfort and light. Good support. The heel is a little lose.": "5", "Just... so amazing. I own a lot of shoes, I've had these for a short time but by far my favorite shoes I own now. Just fantastic. I can't tell you how great these are.": "5", "Superior quality in every way. Down to every detail. The most comfortable D Rose I have experienced. Pictures do not do this shoe justice. Vibrant colors and defining lines. My current favorite in my rotation.": "5", "If your looking for a true fit to size it's here.

This is by far the best Rose shoe in terms of aesthetic and performance that we've seen in the past years. Very happy with my purchase.": "5", "My son loves them but I have to send them back the fit is too big.": "5", "Said enough. The shoe is great on all aspects for a performance basketball shoe.": "5", "Great shoe, ordered half a size smaller because they didn't have my size, but they seem to fit fine and i have no issues.": "5", "Comfort is spot on.

The colors are great also when you wear them its very comfortable.": "5", "Ok fitting shoe. Runs a bit long and wide so I went down a half size. Not to snug around the toe box. A little loose and wide in the toe area": "3", "Love the color trim and design of this shoe. Must remember this is a basketball shoe,cut and go ability with the base of these.": "4", "The shoe looks great! However, the Shoes are missing the iconic brenda tattoo on the tongue, that is listed on the description of those. On this website!!": "2", "Great, comfortable and really cool look. I would definitely recommend.": "5", "Get the D Rose shoes as soon as they come out. They are always sold out and never get restocked. Still a great shoe to play in or if you just out and about. Go a half size down for the best fit.": "5", "D rose is a bumb,but his shoes are cool.if his talent matched style he would still be an allstar": "5", "Great shoe had to buy another color!!\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0": "5", "A great addition to the D Rose collection, and just an overall good looking and good fitting shoe.": "5", "I absolutely love this silhouette! This the best looking Adidas basketball sneaker I've seen since the Kevin Garnett's many moons ago. The lightstrike is pretty comfortable and I'm glad this was carried over from the N3xt L3v3l. They fit true to size for me with a bit of toe room for those who need it. I wouldn't recommend rockin' these loose b/c there is quite a bit of dead space in the upper. Other than that, these are very dope. Especially in the \"Brenda\" colorway!": "5", "This is just a reminder to go down half a size. I went with a 12 because I wanted this colorway and it was the only option left. Go half size down for actual use.": "4", "Love the look and the quality of this shoe.  Lightweight and stylish.": "5", "This is a great shoe for lounging and to chill in, and not just for the game!": "5", "These are way better in person, very comfortable on court, excellent traction and much lighter than expected.": "5", "Love the color way of this shoe! A must have sneaker": "5", "Quality is perfect, comfortable, and valid style. Everything is perfect.": "5", "I have wanted to buy D Rose shoes ever since I missed out on the 7's, but I have not been a big enough fan of any of the subsequent years. The 11 sweet home Chicago is visually the best-looking sneakers I have seen in a long time.  I ordered my size despite the reviews and despite the fact that my Hardens were too big too. And sure enough, they are too long. Adidas measures in their own way I suppose. The width was correct, at least for me. I quickly exchanged via mail my 11's for the 10 and a half so that I could get them before they sold out. Adidas really made that easy. Obviously, I can't play due to the circumstances, but I can not wait to wear these on the court. While trying on the size 11, I did notice the material on top of my toes was pushing down while I was walking to the point it was noticeable bordering on annoying. I hope that it is just part of the break-in period.": "5", "Lucky I have seen reviews about this shoe and I owned the d rose 7 so I know the traction like the back of my hands. Throwback to when I had your d rose 3 brendas :). I'm a size 9.5 and so I went 9 and it was a perfect fit. Maybe an 8.5 if I want the snuggle fit but that's pushing it. I only got to dress it up as gyms are sadly closed for the moment but it's fireeee. It seems the materials need to be broken into as it's pretty stiff outside the box as the 7s did. I love you Derrick Rose and hope one day I can see you ball on the hardwood. God bless you and everyone. (Quick note the lightstrike feels good walking wise)": "5", "These look great, can't wait to hoop in them!Went down a full size (10 to a 9) and they fit perfect, no dead space in the toe box or heel slippage.Quality materials, might best Adidas Hoop shoe I've ever bought. Will be copping a couple more colorways.": "5", "Good design. I love mid height basketball shoes. Excellent lightweight feel.": "4", "I've only worn them 2 times since purchase. I haven't hoop' sun them. The lightstrike foam is super comfy. The materials on the upper feel pretty good also. I'm a true Sz9.5 but I usually get adidas basketball shoes in a Sz9. That's what I did with these. Went down a 1/2 size and they feel great.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe. I always go down a half size but I probably could've went down a full size. The toe box area has just a bit to much space but other than that it feels great.": "5", "The shoe is very comfortable & stylish when using. It is a bit wider than I expected however. I ordered online & the size 12 I received felt like a 12.5 the first time I wore the shoe...I tightened up the laces as best as I could & was able to perform without a hitch.": "4", "For basketball, I haven't experienced a basketball shoe thats better to play for hours in than these. Traction is good and the shoe seems durable, just wish there were more colors. Lockdown is also a plus in these shoes. Love D Rose!": "5", "Fits great. Very comfortable. True to size. Great purchase": "5", "Fit great love the design. My favorite adidas shoe I've worn": "5", "I enjoyed how they fit me and how they were east to play basketball in": "5", "I would recommend this to my friends and family. And i would buy again": "5", "With many different color ways available the Dame 6 shoe has got a style that would fit everyone's taste. These options really allow you to add some flare to an outfit. I started my collection with the white, red, and black. But loved them so much that I've tried to purchase every color scheme available. I'm really going to miss this shoe as they are almost out of stock. But already the Dame 7 has proven to be a very appealing follow-up design": "5", "Great quality and fit! Highly recommend! My son is hard on shoes and these are very comfortable and have held up well.": "5", "One of the most comfortable basketball shoes I've ever owned.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe not to heavy of a shoe.

Glad l got them.": "5", "Love the fame 6s. Great comfortable shoe that feels good.": "5", "Both these for my son, and he loved them. Easy to break them in and great No slip feel on the court": "5", "Bought them for my daughter she loved the color design.": "4", "These shoes are rad! I can see how Dame drops 50 in these. Really comfortable and fit great! They also have good grip so you can cut on a dime and are pretty light as well.": "5", "They are the best hooping shoes and they feel great": "5", "You can shoot deep 3's in these. Watch out for these bad boys": "5", "Have always loved Lillards shoe. Checks all the boxes looks good, feels good, quality shoe.": "5", "They look nice and don't fit too bad. The grip is bad but out some Vaseline on the bottom": "5", "Too few lacing so not as secure forcing you to have to tie it extra tight. This leads to your ankle being uncomfortable because the tongue bunches.  Quick stops force your toes to bang up against the front of shoe; never happened with the Dame5.  Quick lateral cuts can cause blisters because the shoe is not as secure. A huge disappointed compared to stellar Dame5. I will try Dame 7 but if those sucks, I will no longer buy the line.": "3", "Great comfort and I love the design its very rare that you get both of those in a shoe.The choice of colors that were chosen really brings out all the awesome details I would definitely buy them again.": "5", "Great shoes. Purchased a 10 1/2 and fit true to size.": "5", "Exactly what I was looking for great product fit great and extremely comfortable.": "5", "The Dame 6 is worth spending your money on.

Low top so not as much ankle support as other shoes.": "5", "I picked true to size, but unfortunately it was way too big, it felt like a size 13 or 13.5, I definitely recommend going down half size even if you're a wide footer like me. But overall the shoes were pretty dope, decent tractions on all floors, required tons of wipe downs on dusty floors, lockdown was ok i felt like the straps didn't do any good for any forefoot lockdown support but the cushioning system was the best part about these Dame 6s, it was light, bouncy and responsive.

It's great on outdoor courts as well as indoor. I will definitely be buying this shoe in different color ways.": "5", "Just a heads up I would order a whole size smaller if you dont normally use Adidas branded shoes. I decided to order half a size smaller and it still ran a little too big for me. But quality is great. Ive been using it for a week now and am still breaking it in.  I got one blister on the front part of my ankle but I'd still highly recommend. Grip is great and feels solid when I cut. I do wish I got the smaller size because then it would be perfect and I feel I'd be able to cut faster and harder even more.

It is of a supportive shape, and the padding makes it very comfortable to wear.The heel construction allows the shoe to support your foot. The insole is very comfortable, and it provides additional padding. When you are running, it absorbs part of the impact, protecting your joints.The outsole is made of especially sticky rubber that provides excellent traction and increases performance.The top of the shoe is made of mesh, which breathes well and is also durable.": "5", "Sold pair of basketball shoes!Comfortable and light.

The color pops, and the padding and comfort is unreal.": "5", "We purchased the scarlet/ black/ white pair for basketball. My son loved these shoes... the fit, the look everything. About the third wear, the red started to bleed into the white and 2 weeks in they look horrible! Maybe in a pair that doesn't use others colors with alot of white they would be great but I do not recommend purchasing this particular shoe color.": "3", "He loved then and I see that he is very confortable with them": "5", "Shoe was designed for flat foot people I love the comfort and durability of the shoe!

I should've purchased more than one shoe.": "5", "The dame 6 is the most comfortable and stylish sneakers out today. This is my 6th pair of dame 6 and i love this colorway. The green and blue match so good and definitely standout with any outfit. When i wear these about 10 people ask me what sneakers am i wearing. I also have the stone cold collaboration, pusha t all star game collaboration, crazy taxi collaboration, and McDonald's collaboration. The only negative i have is the material over the toes of these and the McDonald's collaboration. The material is soft and it will crease when you walk in them. That is cause they are made to form to your foot when u are playing basketball. I dont play anymore and i wear them for fashion with my outfits. I sometimes wear 2 pairs of socks with the 2 collaborations and that will held them not crease as much. I also put back in toe tissue paper to keep then looking fresh and to take out the moisture out of them, and i keep them in the boxes when not wearing them. That is the only negative thing i have on these two collaborations. I can wear the dame 6 all day and it feels like i dont have sneakers on. I recommend anyone looking at these to buy them and you will be totally satisfied with your purchase. I cant wait for the Dame 7 to be released in October, or if any more colorways get released from the dame 6. Great job on these sneakers adidas, cant wait to see what colorways we get with the dame 7": "5", "Love this player and his shoes!  I hope you do it again.": "5", "I love the colorway. I got these because they make me stand out more on the court. Some people criticize the materials because of the durability. But for me its lightweight and I prefer this way more. Cushion is super comfortable it will help my knees when I do my moves. Went half size down and they fit me super nice. Not to big or snug at all. I think these are the shoes I've been longing for.": "5", "Great shoe to play in and definitely want to get more color ways.": "5", "These sneakers are so comfortable": "5", "These shoes are stylish, comfortable and lightweight.

It's comfortable": "5", "I bought these shoes based on the brand and the look and hoped they would be great. They are. I get compliments on them all the time but my favorite part is they fit my wide but short feet perfectly and comfortably. I bought the 5.5 men's size for a woman who wears 6.5 normally and they fit me perfect. I find myself coming back to these all the time so I'm going to buy another pair.": "5", "I like the shoes for style, traction, and design.

These Dame 6 are light, versatile and perfect for ankle protection.": "4", "Great comfort. Run half size big. Tongue is too big to be functional.

Stylish shoes, bought a few different colors.": "5", "I enjoy this product because of the comfort and control/reaction I feel on the court.": "5", "Doesn't have a lot of upper ankle support but makes up for it with a secure fit around the lower ankle/heel area.

Also got a friend to buy some as well.": "5", "I ended up swapping the day of the dead for the ric flair and went a half size down. I wear an 11.5 in a shoe that rhymes with 'Mikey' 11 in adidas.

With his colab with Ric Flair, he makes a white and gold color way, colors that will always look good together. The shoe fits perfect to size, unlike his last couple shoes, and the quality and durability is much better than the Dame 6. The shoe is not as heavy as it seems and the light strike cushioning feels bulky at first, but over time gets compressed, and feels better than it did at first.

Break-in is underway around the house and home gym.  So far so good.  Lightstrike, like the Dame 6, is great, lacing system is better for true lockdown, and shoe encapsulates foot.  Photos and on-court photos pending.": "5", "The details of this shoe is outta this world. Shoe laces, the bottom of the shoe, the inside sole. Amazing shoe all around.

Unfortunately having two different colored shoes is not for me.": "5", "The quality of the shoe is really good and it's also surprisingly comfortable, a half size up worked really well for me but I think going true to size would just make it really snug": "5", "Go on space mountain with these shoes and bring all the girls home! Wooooo!": "4", "The shoes look great and the materials are high quality. For me personally, it fits tight around the toe box and mid foot, but the back of my foot does slide out just a little bit but nothing too crazy. The addition of the quilted support around the Achilles area is smart and so comfy. The only thing I wish is that the toe box area was a bit wider.": "4", "My kid loves these shoes. Says they are so comfortable out of the box": "5", "Got these for my kid and he absolutely loves them !": "5", "Looks awesome! Ric Flair blue Whoooo!

Good quality, looks great and everything from the packaging to the smaller details in the design was top notch.": "5", "My first pair of Dame 7s; A Great Colorway as well with that mismatching vibe. The fit is great. The cushion feels much better than the Harden Vol. 4s (thicker Lightstrike). These are definitely better than the Dame 6s for sure aesthetics wise.

My only gripe is the glue that holds the shoe.": "5", "I had high expectations for these shoes and they do not disappoint. Being styled after Rick Flair takes them to another level": "5", "Purchased these shoes mainly because I am a big Ric Flair fan. The shoes do not disappoint at all. The little details are amazing.

One of the best looking shoes in my collection as well.": "5", "My son saw these and really liked the blue alligator design and the woo-hoo on bottom of shoe.

Nice traction and also lightweight": "5", "Overall the shoes fit great.  They are slightly too narrow for my feet, but that is really the only complaint I have.  Great support and the design is awesome.": "5", "Impeccable detail on these shoes and really true to both Dame and Ric Flair in terms of all the thoughtfulness put into design. Very comfortable and cool": "5", "Got the navy blue dame 7 and loved the shoe and the style,when this colorway dropped it made me take pause,haven't seen shoes this dope in quite a long while!": "5", "To be the man, you gotta beat the man.

Wooooooo!": "5", "I bought these shoes on whim just because of the Ric Flair motif but surprisingly they are extremely comfortable. I'm on my feet all day at work and these shoes felt great to wear. The colour is fantastic on them too. I like the attention to details that went into them except for one small problem. The problem is unnoticeable unless you look inside at the insoles. One of them has a quote from Ric Flair and a word was misspelled. Instead of it reading alligators it was printed as aligators. In any case, these shoes are awesome. They are so awesome to me that I bought 2 pairs.": "5", "Excellent execution of Ric Flair/Damon Lillard shoe.

Too snug of a fit for my foot though.": "5", "How can you go wrong with the D.O.N. ! Perfect size fits amazingly and get compliments on the reg": "5", "I highly dislike the shoes as it's painful to move quickly in them.

All are same size.": "5", "Well made shoe and I wish I could wear them every day": "5", "Donovan Mitchell is my boy! However, these shoes are not a very good start to the DON line. They are big, bulky, and slide all over the place. I will always support Donovan and his shoe line, but I gotta be honest on these shoes. Not my cup of tea.": "3", "I really wanted to love these shoes because the support, stability, and comfort were all there. My issue is that the traction did not hold up the way I hoped it would. I found myself wiping the outsoles constantly but it didn't even make a difference. It made it difficult for me to make quick moves or to play good defense because I was sliding everywhere. If you're looking for traction, you won't get it with these so I wouldn't recommend them for basketball. But if you're wearing them for comfort or style, then they'd be perfectly fine.": "3", "I love these shoes, not only because they're my fave NBA player's signature shoe and fave NBA team's color scheme, but they are super comfortable! I quit playing basketball a couple of seasons ago, but these are my go-to work shoe. I perform all my honey-do chores around the house wearing these shoes. The width and fit is just right and I can wear them all day with very little fatigue. Sometimes I forget that I'm even wearing them!": "5", "The top of the shoes (where it's on the inner bone near the ankle) is very uncomfortable and hurts to run in them. Thought I was getting a good quality, comfortable pair of basketball shoes but instead I'm left with ones it's difficult for me to run in (although the quality and sizing is good).": "1", "I love the DON Issue #1 so much that I have 4 different colorways.  Very comfortable to play in.": "5", "Satisfied! They are so comfy. I wish I had bought another pair.": "5", "I really like the feel of this show I would definitely recommend": "3", "Nice and confortable, Very stylish and great workout sneaker": "5", "Cool design, but too narrow. Comfortable with insoles.": "4", "Wide base prevents rolled ankles. Definitely recommend": "4", "I own a couple D.O.N shoes and for some reason these make my feet smell bad. And I don't have smelly feet. I've never had an issue with D.O.N shoes before. Other than that, they are comfortable and great!": "3", "Great comfort and fit on the sides. Nice color scheme as well": "5", "Love these shoes and they are super comfortable, the shoes I wear the most often and easy to slip into": "5", "Great design and the if you watched previous Donovan Mitchell's games you will see that he loves to use them": "5", "An absolute steal for the price!

For a 100 dollar shoe, it is made very well and grip is good.": "4", "This is a great shoe and I love the color and the way it looks. This is a very comfortable shoe.": "5", "I only balled in these a couple of times because my ankle was recovering from a sprain but I can say that all the times the shoes were very satisfactory in their performance.": "4", "I recommend these sharp shoes.  Love the color. The shoes fit smaller than normal sizing.": "5", "Kind of wide but still looks and feels great all around": "5", "Awesome colors and theme collab so far .huge fan of donavan Mitchell": "4", "I Love this Be humble colorway of the don issue due to the color combination and the Style. The 3 Stripes in Gold shines nicely on the inside portion of the shoe, and the smooth feel of the be humble gives it a nice touch. The Message is what's most important on the Shoe.": "5", "I bought these last year for my Junior year of basketball. These shoes made a great change in my playstyle and also were very stylish and comfortable. Currently they are my favorite shoes to play in.": "5", "I like the colorists last very long outdoors very easy to wear": "5", "Quality materials and great fit.

Would recommend them!": "5", "Dope a mean with the dope I mean. You know it's trill when it hits in the drill": "5", "Great looking, quality shoe.  Love the design and the really isn't an issue cause I have extra wide feet.  I have 4 pairs of these Don Issue #1's": "5", "Got a lot of bounce with this shoe. Runs a little big though.": "5", "Overall great fit and quality.Craftsmanship a bit sloppy with sole to midsole connection. Not alligned correctly all the way on Right medial side of shoe.": "4", "Shoe looks great and feels comfortable, but for a basketball shoe it has really low cut on the sides of the ankles, which isn't great for ankle support.": "5", "I absolutely love my pairs of DONs. I don't have super wide feet but my dad (same shoe size as me) tried them out and his wide feet did not love these. I also have another friend who needs wide shoes with the same issue so just keep that in mind.": "5", "Would defintily reccomend to friends and family. Great shoe!": "5", "Just wanted to try something new out, was curious and was quite surprised": "4", "I ordered these my true to size(size 8) and i honestly should've gotten a 7, i played in them two separate occasions. first day, i played for about 3 hours, second just one game, the pain in the heels was so bad i opted to play barefoot on an outdoor concrete court. The heel pad on the interior made for comfort was tearing up my skin and that was over a week and a half ago and the cuts were so big they haven't healed yet. I honestly had thought there was something wrong with my achilles' tendons until i took off my sock and saw the giant cuts. again, if you don't have long feet, go half a size down or even a full size down from your regular TTS. your ankles will thank you in the long run, even though by adidas' size charts i should be an 8, there was a lot of heel slippage, even with a runners loop. get your sizing right adidas, i probably would've loved the shoes, everything else excluding ventilation felt good.": "2", "NICE FIT, COMFORTABLE. EYE CATCHING DESIGN AND NICE BLEND OF COLORS.": "5", "Would recommend for anyone to buy. Very comfortable and affordable. Cant wait for the issue 2 to come out.": "5", "Bought these as a gift for my little brother who recently jumped on the Donovan Mitchell bandwagon. He loves them.": "5", "These shoes are nice but poorly made the Width  That runs very tight where can can hurt you foot pretty bad And they are sure not worth buying you are wasting your money trust me it's the truth so I definitely don't recommend them": "2", "Big fan of spida so I had to get these, the shoe runs a big small.": "5", "The shoes look great and feel good. I have wide feet so they are a little narrow but they are breaking in.": "5", "I love the color and they are very comfortable. A+": "5", "They Feel good. They are a good shoe to wear out in public.": "4", "Runs a little big, but love the shoes! Highly recommend!": "5", "I own 5 pairs of D.O.N.

I was very happy with what got": "5", "Comfortable one with great design, I like this kind of Basketball Shoes.": "5", "Shoe fits great and is very comfortable.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a good low top shoe for hoopin!": "5", "This product is something on the lower price side that works well for people of all type of basketball skill level.": "4", "Shoes look awesome with seemingly good traction but way too tight on the forefoot area. Cannot go up half a size as the front would be too long. Also a bit bulky and heavy.

I haven't had a chance to wear the yet but I will enjoy it when I do.": "5", "Fits a little narrow but I have narrow foot so fits like a glove. Great traction and heel support.": "5", "It was a great shoe to walk around in and a great shoe to play basketball in.": "4", "They are just two wide to hoop in and that ruined it for me.": "4", "Never played basketball in high tops before. But these are great!": "5", "As a wide footer, I could have ordered half a size up. Usually I'm TTS in adidas basketball shoes, but I'm sure they were designed specifically for Donovan. Overall, I like these shoes and are definitely in my rotation for hoop sessions.": "4", "Very good quality. Came as expected and comfortable": "4", "They are very light weight and we're really good with traction on the court!": "5", "Incredibly comfortable, really good performance shoes with great cushion and fit": "5", "Excellent!

Look good too.": "5", "Love these shoes and the callback to the original mailman!": "5", "This shoe has bounce which pushes you with every step.

My go to for quick on and off": "5", "The style of the shoe is nice but the fit wasn't great for me. They were just a little snug at the toes.

It is also great on the court.": "4", "Go you're ultra boost size or nmd size because these run big.

Highly recommended!": "5", "Can't wait for issue 2. Adidas did the thing with this": "5", "The shoe is a little heavy but still looks great! I play basketball in them all the time great shoe.": "5", "These shoes are really bulky and just not aesthetically pleasing. They do have a really nice grip and keep the foot locked down tho, as they hug the foot really tight. Good for hoops, just not for fashion.": "3", "These shoes could use more comfort, perhaps Boost tech.": "5", "Pro: Best for wide feet and the wide sole prevents ankle roll on outdoor courts.Cons: Too bulky for point guard": "5", "Great shoe for outdoor play, very comfy and traction is great": "4", "It gud............................................": "5", "Great fit nice movement very pleased with this purchase.": "5", "Didn't like it due to hugging my ankles and the heaviness of it.": "2", "I just live for the green and id say its well worth the price": "4", "They are really fly shoes.

The school I play at has a terrible floor and every other shoe I have slips like crazy on it, but not these the wide base makes for the perfect grip and balance. Snug fit that keeps my foot locked in place perfect for playing D and cutting to the basket. These shoes help me improve my game and I'm sure they will do the same for you. I highly recommend getting a pair.": "5", "I may be a little biased, but I really love these shoes. These are my second pair of Issue 1s and I'm gonna get the Issue 2s day one when they release. I will mention I did have some fraying around the shoelace holes on an old pair, but I didn't really treat those too carefully.

The shoe started to loosing up and feel more comfortable.": "4", "The D.O.N issue 1's a great feeling shoe on the court but casual and comfortable enough to wear as a everyday shoe. They are durable and I never worry about taking out on the street even on my bmx bike the hold up from whips and even foot jams they still have little to no damage, somthing even most other skate shoes can't even due. So no worry on the court or out and about with these shoes.With the spiderman colorway I am blown away": "5", "Feels and performs great. Very comfortable and receive many compliments.": "5", "Very comfortable shoes with great grip on the court. Foot feels locked in.": "5", "Really solid shoes. My main complaint is the huge tongue. Way too big and it is super thin. Everything else about the shoe is awesome": "5", "1/2 - 1 size small, little narrow at first. Great shoe, love all the options.

My favorite shoe": "5", "It was for my son and he is a big fan of Mitchell.": "5", "Very comfortable in the heel box area and the sole in the heel gives good cushion.  Upper is mostly comfortable but pinches the outside toe areas (I have medium width feet).   Could use a bit more springyness in the mid-to-forefront of the sole.  Feels a bit too cushy to really launch.Otherwise, feels like quality construction and very   nice styling.": "4", "My Youngest Nephew will be playing on His Schools Basketball team once School starts back up, also these are His School Team colors...I can't wait to see Him play in these.": "5", "i love oreo shoes and i want to find more oreo shoes.": "5", "To small and not much style feel tide show or small did not like styleSlim and not comfortable": "4", "Donovan Mitchell is going to be a future Hall Of Famer": "5", "Like the colors and the style can't go wrong with it": "5", "Great grip and very light, a Little narrow on both side of the feet.": "4", "Sneakers run large, but they are very nice and comfy": "4", "I have wider feet and its an extremely comfortable": "4", "I think that the colors are SICK!!!! Although the shoes run pretty large. The heal extend quite a bit so  they make them look so much bigger then they actually are.": "4", "I've worn the shoes 3 times and the material on the side has already started to rip. It's pretty noticable and honestly I dont know how it happened because it's in the same place on both shoes and it's not in a place that has scraped against anything. Just seems like bad quality": "3", "I like this shoe. Has a nice wide base for solid footing.": "5", "The Don Issue #1 are very comfortable. Can't wait to break them in to play basketball.": "5", "I decided to try these out because I read some reviews and they seemed mostly positive. I had been playing pickup basketball in my Li-ning Way of Wade 6 and I was looking for something as good. These Issue 1s fit the bill. I like the flat and wide sole because it makes me feel very supported when I make moves on the court. They are very comfortable and the traction indoors was great for me. There was a little heel slippage but I've read that that's part of the break-in process. I've only used them once so far but I haven't felt this comfortable in a pair of ball sneakers on the first try in a very long time. I would definitely recommend. The Joker colorway is also pretty dope.": "5", "Player for my favorite NBA team, Donovan Mitchell.": "5", "The designs are killer, they function well on the court.

Nice grip. And very nice color scheme": "4", "these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought": "5", "I went true to size and it was great fit for the entire foot except for the heel. However, after breaking for a couple of days, it is perfect, no more slippage; it could be due to the fact that the heel pillow is rather stiff to begin with.Toe box was roomy but lenghth is perfect; about 1 cm from my big toe to the tip of the shoes. My feet is measured at 29 cm and I go with size 12, normal width i guess.": "5", "Super comfy in every possible way.  They look great and feel great.": "5", "super comfortable shoe and something that I would wear anywhere": "5", "The fit is great, a little narrow but material and quality are too notch": "5", "I really liked the colors on this Joker version. However, the shoe does not have enough height inside the shoe. The top of the shoe hits the top of the foot at the first outside-side grommet hole. No amount of stretching with double socks will make that pain point disappear. Yes, I tried upgrading a size but it had the same pain point.Probably OK for narrow feet but not mine. Overall quality of the shoe is good except design of the low height toe box. Good price.Maybe Issue #2 of this shoe will fit better.": "1", "This was my third pair and can't wait to get more.": "5", "I think that this shoes is really comfortable. It is a little wide, but overall I love the shoe": "5", "spida colors are amazing,  all the issue 1s are comfortable and look nice.": "5", "I bought the shoes a half size larger and they still did not fit. They are way too tight in the laces area as if they were made for stick feet super narrow. A shame I have to just put them on a shelf like a collector, not worth sending back. Good Price though": "1", "Extremely good looking shoe, and the quality is just as nice. The look is sick. Strangely, I ordered a 10 and a 10 1/2 because I heard they were large. My 10 1/2 and my 10 were the exact same fit, and even with the eyeball were the same length. I don't know what that's about, so I can't help you there. But as long as you get the right fit, I love the shoe. Haven't played it yet, but I bet it's great. Ankle fit is nice, he'll lock down is good, and light but steady. Awesome": "5", "I've struggled to find a shoe that fits good, and then fells good on my feet": "5", "This is my 3rd pair of Issue #1s. I love this color way!": "5", "I bought these for my son. He really liked the style and really wanted these shoes, but the first pair we received were too big and the next pair was a half size smaller but really dug into his heel. Otherwise, the fit was good and aside from the heel, he said they were comfortable. Again, he really wanted to keep these, but the heel was so uncomfortable we had no choice but to return those as well and try a different model.": "3", "They Look Good, They Feel Good, and the Price was Right": "5", "Comfortable and cool looking shoes. Definitely worth the price.": "5", "I love these shoes. The bounce cushioning is awesome!!": "5", "Have been waiting to get some D.O.N. issue #1 for a while now. They did not disappoint. They feel great. Highly recommend. They are awesome!": "5", "The colorways are awesome and definitely make the shoe stand out. Quality basketball shoe with a great price.": "4", "The shoes are really nice. They do take a couple of games to break in and can be a little uncomfortable at first. But once they break in they are quite comfortable and nice to play in. The width is a little wider then most shoes, and takes a little getting used to. As far as size goes, I wear a 9 1/2 to a 10 in most shoes, but got a 9 1/2 in these and have plenty of space and room. My only complaint is I wish they had a little bit more ankle support. If that doesn't matter to you I would recommend them.": "4", "They are good shoes. They fit well and are very comfortable.": "5", "Great traction and bounce! Go 1/2 size down as they run large.": "5", "I was super excited to see that they had half sizes! I wear 13's but they're a little snug sometimes. The 13.5 really fits just right! Love em!": "5", "Good quality. Size run 1/2 size too small I am usually 9.5 and I have to get a 10 in order for my foot to get it hit the front of the shoe.": "5", "This is the best color pattern yet in these shoes!": "5", "The shoes fit great and I love that they are Marvel shoes.": "5", "Like the styling and the colors. Especially like the soft light brown rubber soles.": "4", "They fit well, feel a little chunky but that's to be expected.": "4", "Very comfortable high quality shoe, I would describe solar red as neon orange.": "5", "These shoes with just socks feel good. I unfortunately wear ankle braces when I play, and there's a constant digging in your heel even combined with braces": "3", "Great shoe, comfortable. I love playing ball in these.": "5", "The price point was great for the quality of the product. The colorways available with this shoe are all eye catching while on the court.": "4", "We purchased this for our son's birthday. He has wore them ever since! He normally wears a 10.5 in other shoes but we went with a 10 in this one and it was a perfect fit. He loves them.": "5", "Shout out to Donovan Mitchell and his designers for creating this shoe. I bought this shoe because of the way it looked and the design.  As soon as I put them on, they felt good.": "5", "second pair of shoes, really enjoy playing in them. i recommend buying a size down": "5", "Like the style colors, and the fit .they are very comfortable": "5", "Thisbus a great shoe for a great price. Highly recommend it.": "5", "Second pair of Don Issue #1.  The first pair was narrow but I have a wide foot.  They must have fixed that because these were right on.": "4", "Amazing aesthetic quality and traction is amazing.": "5", "Runs a bit narrow but fits nice. Colors really pop, best combo of this shoe by far": "5", "Everything was as described. They arrived a day early and are of good quality. They are a little narrow Or tight at the big toe knuckle but perhaps they just need to be broke in a little more. Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase.": "5", "You can't beat the price for this shoe! Love them!": "5", "Made cheap, heavy shoe, not good for ballin up.Decoration only.": "3", "I stand all day for work and these shoes have great cushioning and support.": "5", "Comfortable fit and love the colors.  Looking to get the other colorways": "5", "I currently own the Original DON, Solar Orange (Yes it is bright orange, not red), and the Joker issue. I use these shoes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to play basketball in and these shoes are some of the best shoes I have played in. I have played in Lebrons, Curry, Dame, KD, and Irving shoes and none have had the feel and comfort of these. These are very light shoes and have great grip. The low profile makes it easy to side step and pivot without anything extra to trip you up with. These are amazing shoes, so get a pair if you can.": "5", "Good looking shoe  but a little tight on top of foot, I hope it will loosen up with time. The shoe is comfortable for walking around in, but for playing basketball it is a little slippery not enough traction on sole of shoe.": "4", "great fit, good loking quality construction. love the player and the shoe": "5", "Great shoe. Love the design of the shoe. It is a light on the feet.": "5", "The shoes fit great! And they are super comfortable. I really like the color of them too. Not many people make orange shoes either so it's nice to see Mitchell make some.": "5", "These shoes are great. I have a pair for the gym and a a pair for work. Very comfortable and supportive. Can't wait to see Donovan Mitchell's next line!": "5", "Great shoe. I would definetly recommend this shoe to anyone": "4", "I love this line of shoes, I love this athlete! A great combo": "5", "My son absolutely loved the look and feel of these shoes, but traction was horrible.  He had two pairs.  A pair for his school team (Black/White/Blue) and one for his travel team (Black/Green/Silver).  He plays point guard and experienced a lot of slipping and sliding with both pairs.  The herringbone tread pattern are too closely spaced, which collects a lot of dust.  Figured the traction would be top shelf due to the Spider-Man theme running throughout this product line.  Because of the traction issues (I was seriously worried he might get injured wearing them), I decided to buy my son the Adidas Pro Model 2G (White Patten Leather & Black).  He loves them not only because of the old school look has been married up with the Bounce midsole technology, but mainly because the traction/grip is phenomenal and would make Spider-Man jealous. It might have cost me a few bucks, but at least my son has learned the function over form lesson.   Hopefully the D.O.N. Issue #2 product line will incorporate the Pro Model 2G tread design going forward.  If so, we might give them another try next year as long as the color-way styling stays as cool.  If not, hopefully the Pro Model 2Gs are still around, but will have more color-way options.I would recommend D.O.N. Issue #1 for casual wear, because of style and comfort, but definitely NOT as a functioning basketball shoe until the traction issue is remedied.": "2", "I liked them because they gave good traction on the court": "4", "Everything I could have wished for. Keep up the great work with design": "5", "Comfortable and good grip , nice color,  soft heel": "4", "Compared to hoop shoes with boost, bounce needs a bit more to break in. Regardless good hoop shoes.": "4", "Cool looking. Husband buys all the don shoes, we get excited about the new ones coming out": "5", "It took a few days and changing how it was laced before they were comfortable to wear and did not dig into front of my ankle but now they are my go to shoe for comfort. The heel juts out a bit with extra rubber so sometimes i catch my heel on things. I love that the side glows in the dark.": "5", "I find myself wearing these shoes even when they are not the best choice with my outfit. That's a sign of a shoe I love to wear.": "5", "I love the Spider-Man themed Don's so much. I have 3 pair. I would have 4 if I could ever find the Symbiote. I am on my feet all day and these are so comforting.": "5", "great shoes, only flaw is sizing. I went down half a size and they fit great.": "5", "Extremely comfortable and great looking shoe. Perfect shoe for on and off the court.": "5", "They look amazing, but the grip is not good at all. I recommend them if you like slipping around a lot. Want a shoe with a good grip, get the hardens.": "2", "excellent traction and support. I would buy this shoe a hundred times over.": "5", "It's comfortable and fits great.. a it fits a bit bigger than normal so I had to buy a smaller size .. all around great shoe": "5", "My son loves his new sneakers! They are very comfortable inside with all the cushions. Look really cool. The only con is the sole is a little tough, would be nice if it was more flexible.": "5", "Couldn't get a pair during the initial release, but had to get a pair when they were back in stock.": "5", "The shoes are very grippy on clean courts, but they pick up dust really quickly. They have great support and are super comfortable. Also, the colorways are dope. But mine have are beginning to get worn down and rip a little on the inside cushioning.": "4", "Love the DON Issue's Donovan please win the Championship to complete this purchase!": "5", "The shot is a good shots overall, but has less grip than others I have used before.": "4", "I'm gonna keep wearing it but the shoe has gave me blisters already, they gave me blisters in the first practice of me wearing them but other than that's everything else is awesome": "3", "perfect width for wider feet. Perfectly comfortable all around. Grip is better than expected.": "5", "I get to wear my favorite player's shoes which I love.": "5", "Shoe looks great the colors are great and they are super comfortable": "5", "This is the second I bought for my Son! He loves them he said they are comfortable and now he want the white and black pair too lol!": "5", "I got these just for the purple mountain colorway. I typically only hoop in high tops but gave these a try. I went with my shelltoe sizing figuring I'd be wearing them casually which didn't work well when I decided to give them a try on court. Go with your ultraboost sizing if your actually gonna hoop in these": "5", "These are my favorite shoes I've ever purchased. Beautifully crafted from toe to heel. Grateful for Adidas and Donovan Mitchell for putting these out into the world. Thank you!": "5", "Big Jazz and Adidas fan. Have 20+ pairs of basketball shoes and like these a lot. They are just overall very solid in the aspects that are important. A little heavy but don't feel that way on court. Only caution I would give is for those who have knee/ankle problems and need a lot of impact protection. This cushioning has a nice spring and amazing court feel but it does not offer a lot of impact protection on the legs.": "5", "These shoes look really great, the fit is however really tight. Outside the shoes look bigger than your normal size, inside the shoes actually give you less room. If you look at the pictures above, the top view you can see the cushions at the heal take up alot. The tongue of the shoe is actually 1 piece with the top and also attached to the bottom with elastic at the sides, therefore they put alot of pressure on the feet. Basically my point is if you have wide feet these might be uncomfortable": "3", "I respect donavon Mitchell but the shoe is bad no Traction at all": "1", "they provide great support for my feet ankles and my knees!": "5", "Product is not comfortableIt looks big actual size is not comfortable": "1", "This was my second pair that I got and I love them as much as the first! One of the most comfortable shoes I own. Great support!": "5", "The cushion is the best part of this shoe and worth buying because of it in solid rubber on the outsole not the translucent because it picks up too much dust! It's super tight at first over the front half of your foot but after a short break in it's good. Go down 1/2 a size because the shoe runs long!": "4", "Fits perfectly, very comfortable, looks good great price": "5", "I love these. They are really comfortable to play in. I loved them all so much I purchased a second pair for everyday wear.": "5", "Great Support and excellent Quality. My wife love the heel support.": "5", "I liked the styling and when I got the shoe I couldn't believe comfort. Almost no break in period. For a performance shoe its great and cheaper price then other performance bball shoes.": "5", "Well designed, wish it had the D.O.N. On the shoe, but other than that I love them.": "5", "Such a stylish and comfortable pair of kicks! Cool color. Vibrant and bold. Donovan Mitchell's kicks are da bomb!": "5", "Marvel and Adidas together making for one amazing pair of shoes": "5", "Shoes, Jogger Pants and Service are DOPE. I would completely recommend these products.": "5", "this shoe went from plain awful to amazing after one day of use! first day was horrible. I didnt get any blisters because i use great socks but this shoe runs way too small ( and i have narrow feet myself) that being said after just one day, the shoe broken in and has since become one of my favorite basketball shoe! traction is great and support and impact protection are also great. I play indoors only! i can say this shoe wont be for everyone try it on at a store before you buy it. otherwise looks and feels great people alway stare and some even go out of their way to ask me where i got them from and what kind they are!": "4", "For the price and design, it's worth it. Got a lot of compliments about the shoes. And also support my favorite basketball player.": "5", "My opinion on this product is that it's pretty good performer especially considering the price. I've had these shoes for a couple months and used them for different courts. I gotta say I'm amazed. It did almost everything I pretty much wanted it to do. I strongly recommend this productTractionThe traction was good over all. It had a good hard stop on a clean court but on the dusty court it is really bad. I found myself wiping a lot to keep that good traction.ComfortThis is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. It's got a great lockdown in the heel because of all of the supportive foam. The midfoot is got a good lockdown but roomy in the front.DurabilityThe durability is amazing, and I didn't have any fraying on the rubble or cloth. If you play outdoors, these would be really good they even have some rubber on the front of the shoe so you can do toe drags.Overall this product is really good for its price because of it great comfort and lockdown. I just feel like they need to work a little bit on the traction especially on dust. I hope this review was helpful and have a good day.": "4", "I love everything about it the style and everything. I got my lil brother and I matching pair.": "5", "Will be ordering more in future. Fast delivery as well": "5", "For a size 9.5, could not get my foot into this shoe without discomfort. Bad design on the sewn tongue of the shoe.": "2", "The colorway is cold, it's very comfy and eye catching": "5", "I wear them for my leisure time and they are very comfortable and the support for my back is great as well. If you are looking to buy a shoe that is elegant, yet comfortable to wear and you like the Adidas brand, get them!": "5", "Amazing comfort, and stability. I love the snug fit. I normally wear an 11.5 but had to go up to a size 12.": "5", "Lightweight and comfortable. Great price and look.": "5", "It feels like your walking on a cloud.

Issue 2 Shoe so much I've now purchased 4 pairs, in different colors, these being in all black.The design is so stylish.

Need to get more": "5", "Let's go they good awesome great wow genius incredible": "5", "I have wider feet I guess than most.

The colors make it 10x better they really pop on the court and look good on film. Overall on of the best basketball shoes I've worn win a minute.": "5", "They're narrow and tight but I suppose I have to break them in a bit. The support is great and they have a decent amount of cushioning. The color scheme is beautiful and I would definitely recommend these to any casusal b-ball player.": "4", "Too narrow and hard on the foot. Also hard cushion under the foot": "2", "My youngest older this shoe in a size men's 9.

The color never fades": "5", "When I heard these were coming out, I had to have them. Louisville is my hometown and I'm a huge Donovan Mitchell fan. These are strictly for me to collect, however, so I can't attest to how great they are to hoop in. If they're anything like the Issue 1s, though, they should be great.": "5", "My son Vincent loves his new red sneakers.  The other day he was doing \"parkour\" in them.

I didn't expect this kind of finishing from a brand like Adidas. Moreover, the shoe was too tight for me even after going up half a size. I had to return it and no other size was available for me.

I love the design of the shoes but got them how they looked. However I a gold color type of person and was a bit disappointed about how they actually looked. I really liked the gold looking color on the outer zig zag reflective side of the shoe and on its tongue. When I got the shoes in everything was as pictured except for the tongue and zig zag reflective design. That was a big part of the reason I got them and I love purple. A bit of a bummer but everything else design, color and feel was enough of keep be too bummed for a minor thing(sorta).

He wears them everyday and has yet to wear a pair out before he needs a bigger size. Run on the larger size.": "5", "The shoes are lighter than I assume.

No complaints there.They look really good. No complaints there either.Comfort...Hmm. These have potential. Two problems for me though.One, they feel oddly plasticky, and I just don't dig that.Two, where the tongue joins the body there is a pressure point created that absolutely killed my feet. For some, this may not be an issue, depending on your individual foot. For me, it's a deal breaker.

But, the shoe is narrow, I purchased the yellow which is actually a neon orange, and I didn't like the emblem on the heel.  When I called customer service they admitted the color was not as shown, a soft yellow. So if you want an orange, tight show with an I Ugly emblem, buy these! Already returned them.": "1", "A great looking shoe that appears to be well made.

Everyone will be looking at you warring these.": "4", "This shoe runs a bit small. I would definitely recommend going a half size up. I ordered my true size and had to exchange, because my feet were hurting from how tight the shoe was. Not as comfortable as the don 1 in my opinion, but not too bad.

They feel really well built as well, I can tell they'll last a long time.": "5", "The comfort and width was what had me amazed. The shoe wasn't too tall or too short for a basketball shoe, just right.": "5", "Perfect fit and holds your ankles in place with the padding. I will be buying more releases of the D.O.N. 100%": "5", "So far I have all three Crayola colorways two spidey sense colorways and the orange and navy exclusive colorway cant wait to get some more": "5", "I really enjoy the style, only have had a chance to wear them once.

Although the color isn't quite the goldish/yellow as pictured but instead orange.. still recommend": "4", "From the Don Issue 1, I definitely feel there is more ankle support in the 2nd one.

Color scheme is cool": "5", "You can tell the changes from the first one. The grip is definitely better and I liked how the shoe came with a little better ankle support. I would definitely recommend.": "5", "For those who don't have much money but want to ball, this shoe is recommended just go half a size up": "4", "The color really pops and its really stands out.  I bought 3 more pairs in different colors.": "5", "Recommend for every hooper, it fits your foot no matter what kind of foot you have": "5", "i don't know if it was just that i chose the wrong size but the shoe didn't fit well compared to my normal adidas size": "4", "The don is a great performance shoe don't get me wrong it's just a little too narrow for my feet": "3", "The shoes look great.

Good ankle support.": "5", "Shoe is definitely a must have you will definitely be styling wherever you wear them": "5", "Love them.  So comfortable and perfect price for the quality.": "5", "First off the color way is just sick. The tread on the bottom look like spider webs also preforms well. The sock like fit is also very comfortable. I hooped in the don issue 1 prior to these. Gotta day a huge upgrade": "5", "Best grip everNo cap the traction was so good on this shoe": "5", "Definitely one of my best purchases ever made, recommending to everyone": "5", "If you buy this shoe you have to buy it 1-1.5 bigger than issue 1. The toe area of the shoe is much more narrow than the 1. The laces are interesting since they provide more tightness to the toe/upper foot area, but the ankle doesn't get very tight. They grip well on the court and have a good raise up in the toe to help with jumping and running. The shoes do take a while to break in. I've worn them for 3 weeks and they still aren't broken in. Not Mitchell's best shoe. I would suggest if you love the Issue 1 stick with those.": "3", "I mean when I look at a shoe I think of this: Dope or Nope. This was a nope": "4", "very uncomfortable and runs small. the style was nice but can't really wear": "2", "Fun looking sneaker.

Will definitely buy another pair": "5", "not my style thought but is a excellent shoe buy it for my kid": "4", "Cool looking shoe. Color is \"loud\" but it's unique": "4", "Will but again in different colors! Enjoyed this shoe with all outfits.": "5", "Definitely a lot of shoe for the money, with a good firm fit": "5", "Great price.  Nice fit    Super nice color.   Goes great with hero collection.": "5", "Super comfy, but also exceptional on the basketball court": "5", "They feel a touch smaller than adidas 10.5s usually feel to me. That could be down to the break-in period, and it doesn't prevent me wearing them when the time is right. Good padding around the ankle, and the shoes feel well locked down and supportive. They look and feel well made with quality materials.": "5", "I love playing basketball and I love Marvel. This was a perfect storm for me. These shoes are comfortable and excellent traction on wood floor courts. Highly recommend these sneakers": "5", "Colors are great, comfortable minus the tight fit.

I can feel my spidy senses coming on. The colors are phenomenal. Thanks again ADIDAS!": "5", "The shoes are cute in the picture....but total opposite in person. The shoes look bulky and Wide and reminds me of the style shoes that we're out in my middle school days. They appear wide but actually fits small.": "1", "I use the shoes to style myself for work and playing hoops, they are very comfortable and last me I've been an Adidas man since I was young my first pair was some Kareem Abdul Jabbars.": "5", "I bought this shoe in an impulse to see and feel the style of shoes that Harden uses. I can honestly say that the shoe is absolutely amazing. Very comfortable and stylish, it looks great with my Adidas attire. I will recommend the shoe anytime.": "5", "Very comfortable. They don't slide off even they feel like tyere going to. Super grippy which is amazing. 100% recommended": "5", "They are very comfortable for my Mom. Especially with no accessive tightness around the feet.": "5", "Overall great pair of shoes, Wouk recommended 1000% . Made me dunk like a king": "5", "This shoe is amazing.  It hugs your feet in perfect comfort.": "5", "Great look, great basketball shoes, great price!!!": "5", "I can't even wear them and since they arrived while on a trip I won't be able to return them": "1", "Great traction, better than the couple pairs of Jordan's I've been used to lately. Shoe holds up very well for indoor and outdoor use. Overall fit is very good. The upper is fairly soft compared to a lot of basketball shoes and hugs your foot almost how a running shoe does. Sides don't seem to want to blow out, and I have slightly wider feet that don't always agree with narrower shoes.  Great purchase.": "5", "Nice shoe, but I can't enjoy it. The size guide runs large\u2014conversion from men's to women is off. Now they are out of stock and I can't enjoy the shoe.": "2", "The colors are great and they fit great  I love them!

I have purchased three of the same model thus far. The white and blue colors are also attractive and envisioned.  The blue color is not in stock yet, I suppose.  I hope you considered offering credits for my efforts thus far. I am an ardent fan of adidas wears!": "5", "These shoes look great but they're uncomfortable to wear since they're narrow and tight. Might get better after wearing them a couple of times.": "4", "Had to return and order a half size up. Super tight in middle zone. Def need to be broken in a bit. They're fresh though so I don't mind.": "4", "I was kind of unsure about this before I brought it, because I wanted another color and usually don't by Harden sneakers. But once it came and I opened the box, I was happy. Loved the color scheme and it is very comfortable. It also matches with just about anything in my closet. I would definitely buy again.": "5", "The comfort level for this shoe is great and very noticeable with positive comments.": "5", "Quality is amazing, very nice fit without limitations, and the colorway is amazing": "5", "Very premium quality shoe and materials despite low price, it's a cop": "5", "Yes !

Great comfort, style and affordable price! Buying another pair!": "5", "This Stepback 2 line is a great run. They have style, color and a great fit. I really like the neon orange look and couldn't ask for better grip on the hardwood. I'll definitely be getting another pair in a different color.": "5", "Loved the color ways had to have them. A little narrow in arch area.": "5", "I recommend this purchase. Comfortable and feels like I am clouds on the court": "5", "I had no idea what to expect with these, and was happily surprised by the squishy envelopment around my entire foot. They are comfortable and colorful (so I don't get lost in a crowd). The material on the outside is stiffer than I expected, but the inside squish factor means there is still some give.": "4", "I don't play basketball but I do stand on my feet for 8-9 hours and these are so comfortable and supportive and also so beautifully eye catching.

Adidas got you covered!!!": "5", "Light weight and perfect for a game. Great alternative to the sold out shoe.": "5", "These are just an all around great shoe! The style is amazing. The color is so vibrant and beautiful. The size was perfect (I normally wear a size 9.5 in women's but in men size I ordered a half size bigger). They don't cramp my feet or toes. The comfort is unbelievable. There was a slight heel slippage but I blame it on very thin socks. Wearing them with thicker socks you don't have that problem. I've showed them off and everyone loves them. I was very hesitant at first ordering shoes online but I'm so glad that i did! This is a great purchase if you're looking for some good high quality shoes. THE BEST!": "5", "These are some very comfortable basketball shoes.

Ankle support and court feel are superb, they look and feel very high end but the price is reasonable. I just got the Harden 5s & while they are a considerable upgrade (boost, monocoque construction) the step backs are quite close for way le$$": "5", "This shoe has held up to standards in quality. It is used as a basketball shoe only not for regular daily usage though. Will buy again if needed.": "5", "Clean & Casual on the Court! From the beginning of the game till the end of the game!

He loves these shoes so much that he asked for a second pair in size 17 for everyday use (instead of just the Daily 2.0 suede sneakers he's worn for years) so he can save the 16s for playing basketball.  He's picky, but he's also got long, narrow feet, and he's never been happier with the fit and comfort of any pair of shoes like he is with these!  Thank you, Adidas and Mr. Harden, for creating the perfect shoe for my son!": "5", "Overall these shoes were awesome, looked good and perfect sizing for my adidas size. But there is a strap in the middle of the shoe under the laces that clamped down and for me made my foot go numb with a few minutes of court time.

I wouldn't suggest sizing down and if you are in between sizes go with the larger. But the shoe is a joy to play in.

I've worn them a few times for basketball games at my gym and they feel comfortable at first then after running a little bit the sides of my feet start to ache and swell. At the end of my time hooping and taking off the shoes I painfully walk with a limp and have had to ice my inflamed foot the rest of the night.

These Hardens were the first shoes that did not fit true to size. They were actually about a full size smaller than advertised when compared to the Pro Bounces and D.O.N.'s. I had to return them and purchase another set of D.O.N.'s and those were true to size. I bought a pair of Hardens myself and had no problems with the sizing.

A cool basketball shoe with comfort. thanks": "5", "Great basketball shoe, even for a big guy like myself. great grip and comfort": "4", "I like it because it will help with basketball and it is a comfortable shoe .": "5", "It's a little bit to tight. I ordered a size 9 and There a bit too tight you need to go a half a size up": "4", "Fit is perfect, style is great. Been a long time fan of the Adidas brand.": "5", "I love the look they have style and they are comfortable...": "5", "The traction on this sneaker is awesome. I love this sneaker and are my favorite to wear when i play basketball.": "5", "These shoes are very comfortable and look great! Would buy again!": "5", "I loved playing in these. Traction is great. I am a little heavier set guy and I need a good cushioning setup in order to walk away from a game without my knees and feet and back killing me but these do the trick for a shoe that's so low to the ground. I went true to size and had a tiny bit of toe space which was perfect for me. I feel super secure and locked in with the way the lacing is set up and customizable. I love how these look and feel.": "4", "The shoe, to me, is extremley comfortable and stable": "5", "My son has been a huge fan of the Hardens for a few years now. These are light and durable!": "5", "These shoes have cushioned comfort and excellent grip on the court.": "5", "Use these shoes to give you grip and comfort on the basketball court.": "5", "James Harden delivers again with another basketball shoe for the Adidas brand! It's low-cut style allows for excellent mobility while still providing support and stability for going up and down the court! The colorway also is very sleek and ideal to be paired with a uniform or a workout fit for Rec play! Great shoe!": "5", "Purchased this shoe for my nephew and he completely loves it. They run true to size and have great support all around.": "5", "Awesome shoe I play volleyball and dive a lot and the shoelaces ripped pretty easily but that happens with all my shoes. Very comfortable and the color pattern is awesome.": "5", "I was looking for a basketball shoe with good stability and these really worked for me. I definitely recommend if you're looking for more of a low-top style that provides great stability.": "5", "I bought these to coach basketball in. The are comfortable. I like the bright colors. Would definitely buy another pair.": "5", "The design looks cool, making the shoes great for daily wear.": "5", "All movements are covered, the cushion is great, the court feel is on point, simply ending in me saying this shoe will be in my rotation for a long time. The only con is the break in process, the band in the middle of the shoe is quite tight at first.": "5", "The shoe is awesome, my only complaint is the soft part will flake if you're not careful.": "5", "I liked the product, exactly what I ordered. Definitely recommend.": "5", "i like this product because they are comfortable, nice looking, but the gold part in the inside part of ur foot fades away but u know this shoe is nice": "5", "I like these because they are cool looking and perform pretty well.": "4", "I think that these shoes are great and very stylish, But I wasn't able to find a size that worked for me. They run a little more snug than some other adidas basketball shoes I've tried such as the Dame 5's and 6's.": "5", "Great quality hooping shoe once you break them in.": "4", "These have way better heel containment and lockdown than the Vol 3.  They are also much wider, giving me much more confidence to drive hard without worrying that I will tip over on a hard drive or coming down from a high landing.  Traction isn't as good as the Vol 3 but still sufficient enough (at least in the Barbershop colorway) if there isn't TOO MUCH dust present.They do start off right in the midfoot but just wear them loosely in that area until broken in and they fit amazingly well after.  A little long in the toe but the midfoot and heel lockdown make it fine and I actually prefer the extra toe room.The cushioning is nice, not Boost but still provides impact protection and amazing court feel.  Once the insole is broken down a bit you can tell there is still enough Lightstrike for impact protection but it is quite thin in the forefoot. For the Vol 6 it just needs thickened up in the forefoot (heel is perfect).  The feeling is soft (a tiny bit reminiscent of Boost) but not as bouncy and energy returning. I don't feel any pain when I am done playing or soreness so that is a good sign, it's just an adjustment if you're used to Boost.": "4", "I am a highschool basketball player that bought these and use them every day for about three months thinking that the traction would \"break in\" but they never did, this is playing on multiple clean courts as well. Also you can not jump good in them because they are a very flat wide shoe. They are also falling apart at the tip of the shoe, the sole is seperating. Horrible shoe.": "1", "Harden vol. 4 is my best sneaker right now with Adidas, I love the width of the shoe and it's comfortable to wear.  I use to have problem with wearing Adidas because they are narrow and I have wide feet so I have to order a size or two over, but I'm loving this one I don't have to go a size over with 15/16. We need more of the 15inches and 16 width or the other sizes to.": "5", "Doesnt fit well at all...just too tight! Need to redesign shoe!": "3", "HARDEN 4 IS GOOD AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED. IT IS LIGHT AND COMFORTABLE. BUT ONLY ONE THING I HAVE COMPLAIN THAT REAR SIDE MID SOLE CUSHION IS THINER THAN I WANT SO IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR BIG MAN LIKE ME.": "4", "Great court feel with almost zero break in time. If you are looking for cushion on jumps etc I might go a different route but as a guard court feel is key for me": "5", "Good shoes for good price. It's a little too low for my style of play but traction and tightness make up fo it.": "5", "Great for wide feet. I bought my son some Paul Georges and they killed his feet because they were to narrow. He even had to change shoes mid-game. He LOVES the Harden's and wants more of them.": "5", "Stylish, comfortable and affordable can't beat that.": "4", "Adidas shoes I typically have to go a half size up no matter what, so I'm used to it. That's the only thing someone should know before buying. Other than that, comfortable, slick shoe. Exactly what I expected.": "5", "This is a good pair of all purposes, however, still not perfect. The size matter still bother me to pick a right One. It's too tight for me to wear daily if I pick up 1/2 size down. But I suggest everyone get 1/2 Size down of your regular size from other brands if you want to play well in your game. The first pair lace buckle is too far to hold your foot, and the mid sole - lightstrick is not as stable as what ultraboots gives to you.": "4", "This shoe is very solid. However the width of the toe box is a bit to tight for me. I also wish the velvet was replaced with something more breathable.": "4", "I must admit I miss the soft cushioning of boost from the Harden Volume 1-3s, but lightstrike is amazingly supportive and light weight and the lockdown and fit on these is unreal. This is the shoe that the most creative player in the game today helped design and wears for every game. I'll take a few pairs.": "5", "They look even better in person and on feet. Would definitely buy more colors.": "5", "Besides the delivery being 3 weeks late, the shoe itself almost everything I wanted it to be. It is about a half size bigger than my normal shoe size runs though so that was not something I was expecting.": "3", "Great shoe just not much impact protection due to the thin layer of light strike. Other than that materials aren't bad at all and btw it's very beautiful.": "4", "I was really happy with this purchase.  I ordered my true size and they fit great.  Grabbed a pair for me and my best friend": "5", "It was a great gift for my nephew. He own several pairs of the same sneakers": "5", "I bought this pair for my partner and she absolutely loves them, she loves how wide and comfortable the shoe is. She especially loves the colors and she cannot wait too wear them for our pride month. The bottom of the shoe is great, it shows all of the colors and its so vibrant! I will definitely recommend this shoe to anyone who wants too show pride and support.": "5", "As usual, ADIDAS delivered on all  levels. Every year I purchase an item specifically to represent  PRIDE. it's  great to see my favorite brands participate.": "5", "Great look, you can wear these with any color and look stylish and just plain awesome!": "5", "Always wanted a pair of Hardens.  These seemed like a good choice.": "5", "I was hoping this shoe would be as comfortable as they said.  Sadly I tried it twice playing basketball and I had cuts on both ankles (keep in mind I wore a long sock) after that I tried wearing extra thick basketball socks.  Even then it was still really uncomfortable.  I contacted to return it and they wouldn't take it back.  I wore the shoe indoor twice.  Not worth the money.": "1", "Shoes feel amazing on your feet and the colors are truly vibrant. Amazing shoe!": "5", "The colors give you a wide range of clothing to  easily match.": "5", "I love the look, the cushioning BUT the material in the upper is stiff and so when bending your foot, it's a little uncomfortable. Maybe with a few more wears this will soften...": "4", "very fashionable and supports a great cause!!! Plus very comfortable.": "5", "Great comfortable basketball shoe great for just everyday wear also": "5", "Just adding to my Vol. 4 collection. Love the colorways": "5", "Clever vaguely subtle design comfortable shoes stylish and bright without being over the top": "5", "Lightweight, easy slip on, nice surprise with the shoelace tips. The vibrant colors look even better in person": "5", "Excellent fit and feel!  Bright colors and statement!": "5", "Really like these shoes, swapped out the white laces for some rainbow one's. The sole of these are so unique and really turns heads. only issue I've found is toebox is made of different material than other hardens and has some crinkling after normal wear.": "5", "I was in awe when I took these Pride basketball shoes out of the box. The colors are vibrant and beautiful! These are the most beautiful basketball shoes that I've ever owned. They fit perfectly,like a glove. Snug, comfortable fit and like walking on air.": "5", "I love the fact that it is pride support. I own different styles of Hardens": "5", "This Harden is very comfortable, and fits true to size.  The colors are just fabulous. Casual style show off shoe!!!!": "5", "I bought the sneaker to rock casually. I bought my usual size 12 which I had to take back because they were too big. With going down a full size to a 11, the sneaker was tight on my front foot but my heel would still come out the sneaker. I don't understand how James Harden play basketball in the sneaker when I can not walk in them without my heel coming out! Hot design! Bad fit!": "2", "Friend": "5", "I wore the black pair to test out with basketball. The traction indoor (be it well waxed or minimally dusty) was adequate. Outdoors ? Splendid.The heel lockdown is little to poor. Tied tightly they can provide just enough to not bother or notice too much but the feeling is always there. Slowly sliding off of a heel much needing to feel secure.The weight is lighter than I thought it would be. I don't care much for the weight of the shoe to begin with. It affects small amounts of response time so it can be maneuvered around. Impact protection isn't the greatest but I wouldn't say that it is inadequate itself. Just not as supportive as the brand has boasted with many other shoes in the past.Other than that they look great, fit comfortably and definitely benefit any outfit": "4", "Stylist, soft, and comfortable.They look great with a pair of Levi's or sweatpants.": "5", "I will use these shoes for style and comfort and I don't have any dislikes.": "5", "Pro'sComfortableGood grip on the courtLooks niceConsLil bulky": "4", "Bright, Soft. And Colorful.The cushioned ankle support is amazing.": "5", "Shoes tend to wear out fast during crunch time. They don't provide much lift almost like they just quit on you.": "1", "IT'S A PERFECT SHOE \ud83d\udc5e ALL AROUND": "5", "These are very comfortable very durable very nice fit": "5", "These are very comfortable and durable Amazing": "5", "These are the worst shoes I ever gotten. I got a pair for my daughter and another for myself. Let me start by saying the ones for kids are fine. The one for adults are super narrow and hard to even walk in. They seem to be made out of hard plastic and they won't even bend. I was scared if I tried to much they would break. I returned them right away.": "1", "Good thththththththththththtththththththththththththt": "5", "Size lil bigger then usually size if u size 10 order 9.5.": "5", "Great quality, comfortable fit after worn in a bit. feels like playing basketball with grippy socks. I am looking to buy other next-level shoes because of these.": "5", "Purchased these as a gift. They look great and my granddaughter loved them.": "5", "Fits nice and tight! The shoe has no shoelaces so fitting snug is a must. The first time we bought the shoe it was a little difficult putting them on but after the first use it was a lot easier to slide on.": "5", "These shoes would be great if they weren't so hard to get on and take off. The design could use some additional thought with regards to the ankle area. That area, being that there is a tight but comfortable fit. Getting your foot into the shoe is difficult but once it's in, I love how secure my foot feels. As for taking it off, it's extremely extremely hard to remove. If I weren't as strong as I am, I'd have to figure out some extreme measures to remove them. I like the look and feel when on the court; and other people love them as well. Someone thought I had on some Jordan's.": "4", "I love them. Very comfortable. I have multiple pairs.": "5", "I don't know if it's in any way next level, returning it now": "1", "Great shoe. Recommended to anyone just careful when you start using it. Seems a bit tight but eventually it gets better": "5", "This is by far the worst shoe ever made. Just got them today and im returning it tomorrow. It was very impossible to put it on and it was even worst to remove it, very frustrating.Do yourself a favor, stay away from this shoe.": "1", "These sneakers are amazing. Truly thought these were going to fit right and I was super excited to ball in these. Turns out they're too big. Half a size down it would be perfect. Now I have to wait another 8 years until they restock...": "4", "They are very hard to get on . And even harder to get off their they are very difficult but very comfortable once you get them on.": "3", "I have no complaints other than the shoe running slightly long, but even then it's not drastic enough to affect performance. Wide footers may want to order in their normal size. Traction is very good, cushion feels great, and support is very good too. Primeknit feels great as usual. Overall great performance shoe.": "5", "I was skeptical at first, but like the 1st n3xt l3v3l shoes they grew on me. Kinda hard to get on at first, but the support is amazing. I did have to take them off after awhile because they started to feel super tight around my ankle and started hurting. I think they just have to be broken in. Overall im happy with them.": "4", "Molds to your feet great. It will take some time to mold but overall great shoe. They say order a size down but I feel that will be a snug fit for me but you can if you think you want too.": "5", "It's very comfortable and fits well. The cushion was a lot better then i expected. I would recommend this shoe to other ball players.": "4", "Love these Next Level 2020 Basketball Shoes. I love the way they feel and look.": "5", "Size runs big, my only issue was getting the shoe on and off, very very hard to put on. I also got a blister on my heel after jump repetitively but that might just be the size difference.": "3", "I like the design of the shoe; laceless with knit material that compresses and molds to your feet. However, the TPU overlay on the side feels like it's digging into the side of my feet which makes for an uncomfortable experience. I've been told that I am a wide-footer and should use size 10W. Most athletic shoes are sold as 10M so I usually buy 10.5 M, but from reviews online it was recommended to go true to size since the shoe runs long and the design may accommodate wide feet. I've put them on each day to break it in, and it has gotten better (they're not as difficult to put on and take off anymore and the pain on the side of my feet doesn't happen immediately anymore but after some use). The cushion and outsole grip is excellent and I love the colorway! I hope after more use it gets much more comfortable.": "4", "My son loves these shoes.  We bought half a size too big so had to do an exchange.  No problem at all.  It is a little hard to put on at first but they stretch out after a few times.": "5", "These are great for playing basketball and also look great. I love the signal pink. Fit just like it's molded to my feet.": "5", "It takes a lot to get on, but once it is on, you are good to go! Fits well and supports in every way you need in a Basketball shoe": "4", "Love it getting another pair with different colors": "5", "1ST let me say ..  I LOVE THESE SHOES.. MY ONLY ISSUE..  IT TAKES AN HOUR TO  GET THEM ON AND OFF..  THE MOUTH OF THE SHOE IS RIDICULOUSS TO TRY TO OPEN LMBAO...": "3", "Purchased these bad boys and had to return them.  Couldn't get my foot in them! (Size 14, I even ordered a size larger). Long story short,  unless you have long skinny feet... don't even bother.  If the bridge of your foot sits high (the top of your foot, not the arch) more than likely it'll be extremely tight by the natural crease in the shoe where the tongue would normally be.": "3", "The looks really are on the next level, and the comfort of the tread on the shoe is basically perfect, but the tightness factor is extreme. Even though I still have a little toe room in my shoe the fit hurts my feet sometimes when I'm just sitting, but moving in them is great. They're too cool looking not to give 5 stars": "5", "Love the ease of the no laces but still very comfortable and very supportive shoe!": "4", "The shoe was incredibly comfortable but all that cushioning made it feel pretty bulky.": "4", "Works well with grip and quality holds up very well": "5", "Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow this shoe is the best I definitely recommend this product": "5", "First of all I would just like to say that this shoe looks very good plane and simple very minimalist which is a breath of fresh air specially how some of the newer shoes that are coming out are just out of this world. This shoes is very supportive and comfortable but I do wish it had boost but guess it's only because I have foot problems and need a very soft cushioning and I really do wish there was an all white color way please. I do appreciate the curvature on the bottom that adidas added because the first one was very clunky and flat. Traction so far is ok I did had some slippage but the floor I was playing on was alittle dusty and I guess I do have to break it in more first. I do wish the traction was like the one in the bywx and translucent. But all and all this is great shoe lock down is great comfort is great and defenetly would buy and another pair unless adidas would send me some free one lol hehe I have spend alot of money here :( lol. And also would definitely recommend this to people.": "5", "Super Comfy, great fit, great traction, look way better than last year's model": "5", "This is one of the dopest adidas shoe I have ever had the pleasure of the release wow adidas you out did yourself": "5", "The inner sole is amazingly comfortable it took me by surprise": "4", "Clean style and comfortable. Could use a little more cushion in the stwp though.": "5", "Was a little big, sent back for size smaller. I have wide feet and the fit was good, no problems. Look was exactly what I wanted.": "4", "The size is true and width good.  The canvas is a little rough so socks are a must.  Other than that 9/10": "5", "I absolutely love the products from Adidas, and these shoes are no exception. They look really cool and are very comfortable to wear as well.": "5", "The shoe looks amazing. I had this shoe in diiferent colour i loved it thats why i bought again in different colour.": "5", "Love these - very comfortable and go with everything! Slightly larger than expected.": "5", "The shoes are cute was very excited then I tried them on and they wer long and floppy May try a size down": "2", "These shoes are really comfy for everyday running around. I am going to be getting another pair in another color": "5", "I like the colors but I don't like the cloth material": "5", "size and comfort was as expected, had no issue with anything having to do with this order!": "5", "Great color for the warm weather. I like the green with the blue.": "5", "I really like the shoe but the size is too big. I would've returned them but I opened them outside and accidentally dropped them so now they have a scuff on them... sad day... I don't get to enjoy the shoe but I do like them a lot.": "5", "I bought these to go with my Atlanta Braves clothing.  But I wear them to work as well.  Very pleased with my purchase.": "5", "They match everything and work well with jeans and shorts.": "5", "The sole is a little heavy but this is still a great sneaker.  It's a cool design and looks good.  It feels comfortable and and solid.": "4", "Nice looking comfortable shoes. The only thing I don't like is the color gets on your socks": "5", "A nice purchase, I love how they look and match with many outfits. The problem is that they're a bit large for my feet. The problem is solved once you lace your shoes tightly, you get used to and forget that they're a bit loose.": "4", "Beautiful shoes,  I'm happy with the purchase.Very stylish very comfortable goes with any outfit": "5", "This shoe has been a good addition to my shoe collection of which I wear quite often now. The soles are nice and the front is firm and comfy. Love this shoe :)": "5", "I like the gray in the lettering and the style is very nice and clean!": "5", "I got an 8 1/2 for women and these are big for me. Kinda makes me feel like I have clown shoes on": "3", "I like the style very much! I think it's worth getting": "3", "Pretty comfy. Seems well made having not wore long. I needed a size smaller": "5", "I was going for something retro but in a preppy classic way. These nailed all the spots! Have been an adidas girl forever.": "5", "I was in need for a pair of white shoes that go with all my jeans. These are perfect!": "5", "These are the perfect fit. Bought them for my husband and every now and then he'll get a half size up for a little wider of a fit but these are perfect at his normal size. Very comfortable and even more stylish looking in person.": "5", "These were true to my normal size like most of my Adidas. I did not need to order a half size bigger like I sometimes have to do with some of the other narrow Adidas shoes.": "4", "I got this shoe for summer but as soon as I put it on I fell in love.": "5", "Love the quality and the comfort. I'm impressed with the style": "5", "I got them blue got a smaller size they run a little big but love them": "5", "I ordered the wrong size at first, but the correct size is so comfortable. I love wearing them for work as I work in a dermatologist office.": "5", "Great quality  great price. The shoe is comfortable.": "5", "Love the look of shoe and size  is perfect.. I think Adidas could have come up with a better sole for the shoe .. it a bit thick and doe not give and makes for a stiff and slightly uncomfortable walk ..": "4", "I usually don't buy white shoes but these ones really grabbed my attention, and boy I'm glad they did! They are so stylish and about as comfortable as a canvas shoe can be, really a good addition to any wardrobe.": "5", "A relaxing shoe. A good shoe for a day off. Not for high mileage in a day. More for low stress days.": "4", "I bought these shoes for my days off from work I work in a warehouse all day so I just wanted comfortable lazy shoes that I can throw on when I needed to go running errands, goo to the mall or go out to a restaurant with friends": "5", "Canvas instead of leather.........................": "3", "My daughter loves the fit and says they are very comfortable throughout the day. Quality of the shoe is great!": "5", "Too big sizes arre not normal.............pppppppppp": "2", "Maybe i should have bought another size. The one i picked feels kinda baggy": "4", "Love it for wearing inside the house.  Love the retro style and the fact that the rubber souls squeak on the tile and concrete floors makes me love them even more.  A good classic sneaker.  Great addition to my collection.": "5", "Shoes fit awesome, very comfortable and the quality is perfect": "4", "Had to return, too big.  Have narrow feet, looked silly on me.  But I love the look of the shoe,  size could work for others.": "3", "So nice so comfortable and size is perfect it's great": "5", "I love the material and design of this shoe. The stripes are almost like a strap texture and it makes the shoes pop in the right light as the different texture pop almost out of nowhere. Very stylish!": "5", "This shoes are nice but too simple. I think a more comfortable insoles would make a huge difference": "3", "These shoes look so clean, I don't want to wear them out. Very comfortable.": "5", "nice casual sneaker. goes with anything, timely delivery": "4", "Me and my husband love our shoes and will be purchasing some more": "5", "Overall I like the style of the shoe... definitely on the casual side.": "4", "I bought these for work and they've done a better job than my old used ones. the quality looks new even weeks after wearing.": "5", "These shoes are exactly what you'd expect from a canvas flat. Nothing special. They are worth the price though, because they're dope.": "4", "I ordered a 6.5, My normal size. It was about 3-4 inches too big. I'd recommend sizing down.": "5", "Comfortable and good for leg day ! They look good !": "5", "Just what I wanted. Perfect fit, style and light weight without additional padding or insulation good traction and durable sole": "5", "light, comfortable,  and breathable.I got a second part of different color.": "5", "The sole seems like it is broken. It makes a very werid and attention grabbing sound when walking around.": "3", "This shoe is very poorly made. Had to return because of that.": "1", "They do run just a tad big but I absolutely love these shoes. So clean looking, I love them.": "5", "If you're in the market for the most comfortable and stylish shoe, this is it": "5", "It's a stylish and comfortable shoe.  Great ankle support.": "5", "I got size 8 but it was so big like size 10 so I'm gonna exchange it for 6,5": "5", "Bought for my husband. My husband needed a casual shoe instead of those clunky tennis shoes for his more casual outfits. He loves them!": "5", "These shoes make me wana buy adidas more and flex on yall": "4", "Got these for my son as something different, it was a surprise and he fell in love with them right away, it's hard to please a 17 almost 18 year old cause they are so stuck in their own fashion sense. But I'm never too far off with him. Mom did good and he LOVED THEM! Actually thinking about another pair once his swelling goes down from a work injury to his foot. These are a little more fitted but the overall sizing is spot on for the foot that is not swollen!": "5", "fits perfectly and stylish": "5", "Needed a shoe that matches my personality. A simple but basic shoe that goes with anything in my closet.": "5", "Quality product very good looking shoeGood craftsmanshipGood": "5", "Mine ran a little bit big, but they are still very comfortable": "4", "Nice product, made with comfortable high-quality materials.": "5", "Was hoping to order another size now I can't find them . .. sad": "3", "This was perfect at size the looks and style are amazing and very well made I very recommend it.": "5", "Overall a good pair of shoes would prefer a padded tongue and softer insole": "4", "fits great and looks great! everything about it is perfect": "5", "These shoes are great. They fit perfect and aren't too tight. The only issue I have is that the shoes do rub the back of my ankle raw. Other that that perfect shoes.": "3", "I like this style , very comfortable and looks good": "5", "Nice shoe, nice fit, nice looks. Only problem I have is the tongue and laces seem to be an after thought in quality but not a show stopper. The white ones don't have a logo tag on the tongue like the blue ones and the laces are a bit flimsy. Still would recommend them though. Now if they would only bring the AdiStar Racers back.....": "4", "I've been purchasing and wearing 10.5 shoes most of my adult life.  Including multiple pairs of adidas over the years.  I was how surprised at how big these were when I put them on.  Could have gone with a 10, maybe even 9.5.": "3", "I'm normally a US women's 8.5 but I'm wearing a US men's 6.5 in these.. it took me awhile to find the right fit but adidas was really great with free convenient exchanges. Now that I have the right fit they are super flattering and very stylish. They are like an indie cross between a converse and veja. I like having something that is on trend but not the exact same thing as everyone else! Great quality. Comfortable with no rubbing.": "5", "This pair was a gift to someone and they fit them perfectly. My only complaint is that they get dirty easily and the cloth material is hard to clean, BUT that's white shoes in general! Love them, so does my bf.": "5", "I just love these shoes! Great for any outfit! Work and play all day!": "5", "Love how they look, love that they're all black, I definitely recommend these shoes.": "5", "Before purchasing these shoes I read the reviews on how the shoe fit.

What gives?": "4", "Nice color nice fit great overall shoe for the price color way outta this world": "5", "I put these on a soon as I got them and immediately decided to return them.

I highly recommend": "5", "This is my eight pair of this shoe. I have had a few variations such as color, size (lows) and renditions of this shoe. This was the shoe I was for high school basketball in the mid 2000s. I bought a pair before my junior year in the summer. I think bought a white pair for varsity as a junior. I got another pair as a senior. I then got two more pairs in the next couple of years for pick up ball. Then this shoe was discontinued....that sucked. I floundered from shoe to shoe for legitimately 10 years until last years reboot when I bought a pair and this pair. I will probably get another one or two so i will be good for the next 10 years.It is strong but not too heavy, I actually thought it was incredibly light in high school almost like I had no shoes on at all.

I suggest using real leather instead of patent leather because patent leather tends to crack with wear over time.

Top 3 comfort shoe on the court. Saw them on sale and had to get them again!": "4", "Bought these for my son in red. He absolutely loves them. He's so comfortable in them that he's just about been wearing them all of the time. What we didn't realize upon ordering is that the shoes are more like patent leather, which my son was totally fine with. I'm sure I'll buy these again for him, as he's already asked for a second pair in another color :)": "5", "Great comfort and grip. Bought 4 more pairs! After I received these.": "5", "It is a classic shoe. I enjoyed buying it and they look sharp.": "5", "They are so stylish. I love them to pieces. They fit so well.": "5", "Sweet.

However, the patent leather makes it look more like a dress shoe look, and I expected a more subdued appearance.": "4", "It's a great looking sneaker and fits perfect will but others like it": "5", "Old school look but very stylish..Adidas had a similar limited edition a long time ago...Maybe around 2001-2002. This style is very similar but the difference on this patent leather shoe is they added the original shell look on this model.": "5", "The comfort level is like walking on clouds. They could be worn for work, out on the town, and be a great decision on the court...": "5", "Size 11 received in like- new condition, not brand new. Bottom appeared worn": "3", "Clean, classic look.

I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member!!": "5", "Loved the clean look of the shoe , reminded me of the classic superstar, when the white and black stripes. These caught my eye when I saw Zach Lavine wear these shoes in a game. They have great support around the ankle and are comfortable as well on the court. They are true to size and have a great lockdown feel once you lace them up.": "5", "Like the look, but gave me blisters on the top of the 4th toe on each foot. The Shoe fits good, don't know if it's the stitching or a defect within this shoe, but have only wore them once because of this, disappointing.": "2", "Been happy wearing Adidas, since the '70s. This pair continues that streak.": "5", "I love the 2G a fantastic shoe it fits the foot like a glove able to move with the cutting edge of the body weight and movement I've always been a fan of the shell-toe family with Adidas always a great long-lasting shoe awesome": "5", "These fit me like a glove and they are super comfortable. My brother in law loved the look so he got a pair too! Very versatile and stylish. I didn't have to size up or down. I would definitely recommend these.": "5", "I prefer the \"old school\" hi-top all stars that I wore in college (70s) That model look better with jeans! Why did the price of those go up 3X from 2017? Did I start a trend???": "5", "I love how comfortable and stylish these shoes are plus they have a great bounce to them on the wood floors. They make your jump feel higher and have great traction on the wooden floor. They do take a while to break in but they are extremely comfortable.": "5", "It is taking some time to break these in. I find them to be u comfortable, after wearing them for about a week now. They hurt around my ankles, but will give great ankle support while playing ball. I want to break them in before wearing them to play. They are stylish, so I am able to wear them with anything and they fit just right (to size). I am really hoping they will become more comfortable once they are broken in. The material makes them easy to clean, just wipe with a wet cloth. I will write another review once I have them broken in.": "4", "Wear for extended time of walking very supportive, great shoes": "4", "About as gold and black as you can get.  Should go good with Jerseys.": "3", "A perfectly crafted basketball shoe, Personal Top 10 of all time. Sleek, stylish & durable, these patent leather heaters look great on & off the court. If only adidas basketball capitalized on the Pro Model design more with a Harden/Mitchell/Young..": "5", "bought multiple pair of the pro model 2g back in high school and wore them out. When these re released i had to get them. i miss the low version of the past but this mid version is just as good. I only wish there was a full leather version not patent leather. i think it runs true to size for a adidas shoe. I wear a 10.5 in most shoes, ultra boost and jordans i wear an 11. i got these in 10.5 fit great.": "5", "These shoes are not only great looking but provide the much needed comfort and traction on the court. Basketball tournaments get long and you spend a lot of time in your basketball shoes and these held up great. There a lot of compliments on them as well, adidas is a very popular brand around here!": "5", "Most comfortable shoes I ever worn. Very durable. Lightweight bounce comfort in the midsole. Very easy to clean.  And the extra rubber at the toe keeps the shoes lasting longer. Has slide grip on the bottom sole for extra grip and slide prorection.": "5", "I love the comfort and snugness, feels very supportive.": "5", "The look of the shoe is amazing, clean, simple and classic. Afraid to get them dirty being so white. Not sure about the material on the show, nervous it would rip.Comfort is ok, a little hard near the toe inside. Something was rubbing on the side of the shoe on my toe. I wore for practice, and the traction on the court was point on. No slipping at all. If you are looking for a classic shoe, this one is very comfortable.": "4", "I bought this product to play basketball in, and it grips the floor really hard. Good Job Adidas.": "5", "I received the red adidas and they are some very nice looking shoes. I received several compliments about them and how nice they looked on me.

So disappointing! I even had it shipped from the US to Canada just to have them.": "2", "Great fit! Look sweet! Really comfortable.The most comfortable pair of Kicks I own...": "5", "Looks great, very comfortable. I wish the she was wider.": "5", "I've been looking for this shoe for years. I will buy a couple more pairs for my son and I.": "5", "Love the mix of materials. It looks great and catches the eye but not too flashy.": "5", "Comfortable basketball shoes. Great for tall guys.": "5", "Perfect traction, Bounce cushioning really enhances the original design. Bought the blk/white and about to grab the blues.": "5", "The cushion of the heel is as good as the pair I had 15 years ago. But I found my feet can't be locked well enough like before. Any way it's not bad choice considering the price": "4", "Old school but still awesome. I have nothing else to say": "5", "Had a bought my first pair of these in 02-03. Black patent leather with the interchangeable stripes. Saw adidas re-released the shoe and knew I had to have them! This retro performs just as well as the original. From the traction to the fit, along with the upgraded cushioning system. Flawless execution adidas!": "5", "This nostalgic sneaker is the perfect basketball shoe!": "5", "It's a beautiful shoe an it's very comfortable you can wear these all day long malls,theme parks, the other pro model hurt your feet after a while not these might get another pair": "5", "Style slightly different from last pair but these are VERY comfortable": "5", "One of the best bball kicks of the early 2000s, reminded me of my Highschool days! Wide foot friendly, comfortable,durable. Best part -> TRACTION. Traction is beastly!! Thanks for bringing these back with UPGRADED TECH SPECS!": "5", "Loved these shoes in the 2000s. Was very excited to see them back. The comfort is great! My only complaint is the shinny material there made of. Need to go back to the satin finish!": "4", "Very comfortable and handles well on the court. I'm glad these were brought back.": "5", "They are as comfortable as the original version. With the bounce cushioning and excellent traction, they are still good basketball shoes on the court.": "5", "Good to see Pro Model 2. I'm older and like the old style basketball shoes.": "5", "Remind me of my Highschool days! One of my fave shoes to play basketball": "4", "Classic look with modern Tec feel. Looking forward to wearing them in my next bball game. The Bounce makes a huge difference on how they feel on feet. And the differance is a good one.": "5", "I've e been a fan of shell toed adidas for a long time.": "5", "Very secure fitting shoe. I look forward to wearing them long enough to feel them break in like a pair of slippers.": "5", "Very nice and comfortable shoe I love these shoes and thinking about buy me a pair black-and-white ones": "5", "These shoes can be worn on a casual date or to your place of employment, they're versatile.": "5", "I love the style and colors. The red and gold strings are looking good. I recommend buying them.": "5", "I am disappointed with my purchase. Since I always wear ADIDAS shoes, the quality of the insert is so bad. My feet sweat in those shoes way more than in other pairs. Since day first, the fabric scratches my skin to an uncomfortable level and an actual irritation.  When wearing high socks is not much more significant, change nighter.Honestly, pore quality and not worth it": "2", "I love them, but they run small. Size should be compatible to my other Adidas shoes in same size": "4", "The size was right on so comfortable easy to break in to fit": "5", "A classic look with an updated feel. The Adidas Superstar was THE basketball shoe starting in the early 70's pioneered by the UCLA team in 1970 with Sidney Wicks. Even longtime Converse stalwarts like Jerry West and Oscar Robertson changed to the Adidas Superstar, as did Kareem and so many others. By the mid to late 80's shoe technology advanced and the original Superstar was no longer a viable fit and feel. In 2000 Adidas used the Superstar styling, the original capped toe, but reinforced the support and structure of the shoe. This is a marvelous version. My only suggestion is I would love for Adidas to offer this shoe with original black, Indiana Hoosier red, and UCLA blue stripes. For guys my age this is a shoe I would want multiples if there were color choices for the 3 stripes.": "5", "Shoes are very comfortable. Love the look! Great feel when walking and working. I'd buy them again!": "5", "Although my grandson loved product, he is between youth and men's size and we couldn't find right fit. He was truly disappointed. Shipping and returns and ultimately refund were remarkably fast.": "4", "I wish there were more color options for this shoe!!  They are super comfy and a classic and I love them!! I had these when I was younger in different colors. I love these!!": "4", "Nice shoes. Would definitely recommend them to other people": "4", "I have been waiting for these to be re-released. Thank you- just wide enough comfortable enough and classic look. Please consider the black stripes, boost and then wide and extra wide instead of the strutters- you will kill it.": "5", "Very comfortable and I love the colors plus they match my other adidas gear": "5", "Could be a little bit more comfortable for the insole": "5", "I wore these shoes for more than a decade before they were suddenly discontinued, and spent the last 8 years looking for a replacement.  Nothing out there comes close!  So glad Adidas brought the 2g Lows  back.  Also...if any Adidas execs are reading this...I'm ok with the white on white scheme, BUT make these in the old school White with Navy stripes and embroidery, and I'll by a lifetime supply!  Thanks!": "5", "Classic looks, style, and comfort. They run a little on the narrow side. A half size up may work better for some. Waiting for all black in mid, wink wink.": "4", "I normally wear a 6.5 in shoes but these I had to get a size up to 7.5 because they are very tight on the sides but comfortable so I would recommend these shoes as long as you get a size up but they are comfortable to wear!": "5", "Sleek, Comfortable and Sturdy. I play a lot of pickup basketball and am a fan of Adidas products": "5", "These go nice with my track suit...like RUN DMC.   Picked up the all black ones too.": "5", "Please keep making this style in different black and white patterns. My fav of all time! Super comfortable too!": "5", "i love these sneakers they fit fine and look great    keep up the great work": "5", "Have not seen these shoes in  I don't know how long on the website one day and there they were had to get them love these shoes !!!!!!!": "5", "I hope they keep these around awhile this time just like my favorite old pair from 10 years ago": "5", "PRO MODEL 2G FIT PERFECT, LOOKS GREAT, HAS ALL THE GREAT ATTRIBUTES YOU EXPECT FROM A BASKETBALL SHOE. CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR THEM WITH MY TIRO 2021 SOCCER WARM -UP AGAIN...THANKS ADIDAS FOR MAKING THIS SPECIAL VERSION LOW TOP PRO MODEL!": "5", "So happy that Adidas brought back my favorite shoes. I love everything about them.": "5", "I use these shoes for reffing and they hold me down very good without sore feet and they hold up my flat arch great shoe": "5", "Not only a great look, but strong comfortable fit as well ..": "5", "Been searching for these shoes for quite sometime and overwhelmed to get them again.": "5", "These were my favorite shoe growing up. It really sucked when they went away. The OG Superstar was a close fit when they returned but nothing feels better on the foot than the 2g. When I slipped them on it was like a warm hug from a long lost friend. The only thing now is bring back the color selection on the stripes.": "5", "I've been waiting for this shoes. Its so comfy and has nice design I just hope they would release the classic color of white and black stripes.": "5", "I've been wearing Superstar 2Gs since 2004 for all my outdoor exercise activities: Basketball, tennis, running, walking, even skydiving once. When Adidas stopped producing them about a decade ago, I bought the few pairs I could find on eBay and hoped they would bring them back eventually...While the Pro Model runs slightly bigger than the my old Superstars, it is, for all intents and purposes, the same shoe I've always worn with even better cushion. I think I'll probably order a half-size smaller for future pairs, but the combination of comfort and functionality is unmatched in my opinion.": "5", "The pro model low is a great all around shoe and the triple black is really unique": "5", "Great shoe, looks good with just about any outfit!! Classic with a new jack swing!!": "5", "Great quality and perfect fit to the size. The shoes are fashionable as well and can be used in multiple ways.": "5", "Happy to have them back the best shoes.

True to size.": "5", "Need to bring them in different colors a lot of people want to see them in different colors": "5", "Glad to find my size  makes great golf shoes for me and helps with the arthritis in my feet. Could wear them for every occasion.": "5", "Great Shoe!  Stiff at first but broken in by end of day.   Glad to have this style back!": "5", "I've had over 10 pairs of the superstars over the years it is the best shoe ever made . These are exactly like the original ones I just wish there was more color choices.": "5", "Originally bought these for work but I ended up liking them too much to beat them up at work. Instead I decided to use them as my everyday chill kicks. Great buy at a great price.": "5", "I love this shoe.  I used to wear the superstar 2G and when it stopped production I was crushed.  I just ordered 2 more so I have them on hand before they sell out.": "5", "Fit is ok for wide footers like myself. A little snug in toe box area but broke in after wearing. Some minor heel slippage but adjusted laces to fix. Bounce cushioning made this very comfortable. Could probably hoop in these but only use them for casual wear.

Get yourself a pair!": "5", "Still love them......................................": "5", "Got these for summer hoops. Little stiff but think they will work. Really like the look and support.

Product quality recommended.": "4", "Shoe is very comfortable. Great support and stability": "5", "I wish there would have a red stripped option. I choose the all white and the stripps were a shiny white. I didn't like that. I would have rather a natural white with texture instead of the shiny plactic look.": "3", "Worst purchase ever shoe blistered my foot. Overall shoe performance wasn't bad but the blister ruined the shoe performance.": "1", "I've been waiting for Adidas to make this style again for longer then I can remember, and they do not disappoint. The Pro model is so comfortable with the extra cushioning in the side walls and tongue compared to other versions. The solid construction, wide base and overall bulk of the shoes is nice as well.They huge my feet perfectly and have an unmatched look and feel.Now I wish they would make more colors so I could stock up! Hint, hint adidas......": "5", "The quality and style of this shoe is tops, but the fit was way too tight & narrow and  uncomfortably constricted on the top and sides of my feet.

Can't wait to see more drops!": "5", "Great looking shoe that's even more comfortable. Love that this colorway is LOUD, but not too loud.": "5", "I love the DON 1. The DON 2 is very high quality but it is narrower than the DON 1, the heel area is soft, but it touches my very sensitive old man achiles tendon, and there is a bit of a rocker sole to it. The cushion and build quality are similar to the DON 1, the traction seems good, this shoe just isn't for me.": "3", "This shoe does true to Dons game. It has great support and coshion, but it's a little heavy. Very comfortable running up and down the court, and traction let me do some great stuff. Would recommend.": "5", "Great looks.

I wish I knew this before hand because now I have to go through the exchange process. So to whoever is contemplating buying this, MAKE SURE TO ORDER A SIZE UP! Other than the sizing, I LOVE these shoes. Spider-Man has been my favorite superhero for as long as I can remember.

I love these shoes so much, I got 2 colors :)": "4", "I wanted these shoes incredibly bad but for my first pair of Adidas I wasn't sure what size to order.

Very comfortable and breathable.": "5", "In terms of quality...style and colorway options...price...having a signature line...all of it...this is arguably the best shoe out there. Not everyone's a huge Westbrook fan but, you should be a fan of these sneakers. They play great on and off the court. I have two colorways and will probably grab a third when another big sale happens.They are very customizable...maybe a hair wide, compared to most Nikes/Jordans...and a little higher arch than most (I have flat feet and it takes a little adjustment).": "5", "When I saw these, my first thought was that they looked like the cross trainers that Bo Jackson used to rep.  The cross strap mid-shoe really allows you to customize the fit for support or comfort.  They look great and feel great.": "5", "I have not tried them on the court yet because the indoor courts are still closed but when I tried them on after I received them they were very comfortable. I can't wait to try them out on the court along with some other kicks that I have still in boxes.": "5", "These are so unique and different in person even when i saw them online i was saying to myself (I just had to have them) ..... At first when i picked them up from the box i was like (these seem kinda big in my hand) lol but there really not once i had put them on....

For casual wear its ok, there is really no true support of any kind for real physical play. Looks great with anything. Due to the little padding, the size to me felt a little big so I dropped down a half size. I like them but they are not a go to pick for me. Definitely one of those few sneakers that can fit anyone's persona": "3", "The chuck Taylor hi's are awesome. I have the lows to and both are a classic. If your a real sneaker head you have to have these in your lineup!": "5", "loved them": "5", "In larger sized Chucks the shoestrings should be longer.

I like the idea that you are able to dress this shoe up or down.  The shoe is a true fit, so be sure to get your size or you can go down a half size (.5).  I am typically a 9.5 and chose a 9.5 because I wanted room to wear thicker socks with the shoe, but a 9 would have fit perfectly.  I have an average foot, so i'm not sure if going down a half size for those who have a wider foot would work.": "5", "Needed some new shoes for leg day at the gym!

I tried it for the first time and it is really awesome.": "4", "The shoes are great, however I did not realize they were Unisex sizes. I searched for women's size 6 red Converse and picked these because the red was a little darker that the other version. However, when they arrived they were MENS size 6 (which is Women's 8). To be fair, it does say Unisex in the description, but I didn't catch that since I filtered my search for Women's.

Super comfortable and goes with everything": "5", "The shoes look great and I loved them but it was too big so I have to get a size lower and see what happens!!! Am usually a size 8.5": "4", "They are a decent pair of sneakers but being canvas and white once dirty they are impossible to clean short of the washer machine and that breaks them down! Is there a spray to help protect or help clean the canvas material, it smudges!": "3", "Since the shoe is all black, it can be worn nicely with anything and will never be noticably dirty.

The exterior is very easy to clean so you can clean a dirty mark or a scuff anywhere with just a wet wipe. A lot of my friends have them so yes I decided to jump the train. I do use them for track, random outgoings, going to friends house, relaxing/casual hangouts, so pretty much anywhere I can wear them I will because of easy on and off and its iconic look. See I had crocs back when they were sold for waay cheap and you were picked on if you wore them. To see that it has made a complete 360 and is now a big mark in fashion that even Balenciaga had to get in on the action.

Not once have my feet begun to hurt or cramp from discomfort. At first, I thought I needed a bigger size, but after my first wear they formed to my feet and I'm in love. The only con is the fur inside. I love the fur, it's so comfy and they keep my poorly circulated feet warm and toasty. The con is washing them, older versions allowed people to take the fur out, throw it in the wash and go. This version is sewn to the croc, making cleaning them difficult and annoying.

The original crocks were made of a softer more pliable material than the stiffer materials used now. I also had a pair that didn't have any holes at all that were great for use in the garden.

I have narrow feet with high arches, and they are a perfect, if roomy widthwise, fit. My toes do not come to the very edge nor do my heels. They are situated exactly as they should be. They feel great--perhaps even more comfortable than the classic clogs (the nubbins are not as pronounced--sometimes I find them a touch irritating, but I have sensitive little feet, lol). My only complaint is the lack of color selection on the Crocs site. Where are all the fun colors? There should be lime green, yellow, purple, teal, etc. Hopefully, Crocs will restock more for the coming summer. The orange are adorable even without charms (I ordered a bunch of Jibbitz, but they have yet to arrive). Additionally, come on, Crocs, restock the good Jibbitz. The US online store never has any good ones :/ However, despite those quibbles, I am a very happy camper. If you're foot is like mine, go with the smaller size, and you'll be set. I plan to purchase more colors (and I already ordered electric pink and white), since I'm sure I'll be living in these for summer. They are great for around the house, the pool, and yard work.

They're a little on the wide side, but they're not made for support, so the width adds to the comfort. And they look great!": "5", "Color in picture is accurate. Size runs a touch big but still comfortable.

Great for around the house.": "5", "Width is pretty wide and the i got a whole size up and my toes still slid and hit the front due to material. However, I added insoles and it's perfect!!!!

She usually wears between a 9 and 9.5. When she tried them on she said it felt like her heel was hanging off the back of the shoe. We returned them, which was super easy, and got her a 10. Now she will not take em off. So if you're one of those people that bounce between sizes or half sizes because of the manufacturer, do yourself a favor and order the next size up.": "4", "I purchased these for work.

You'll get several compliments when you wear them. They are very detailed, more than the Yeezy slides.": "5", "I was looking for a winter alternative to slides for going to the gym and sports leagues. These are perfect. I wear a 10 in women's, and these run pretty big, I'm assuming because they're unisex. I'd feel comfortable telling women to order a size down. Given the nature of the product, it doesn't really matter. They're light, so they don't fall of or anything. These are seriously my favorite thing that I own!": "5", "I love these sandals but it's a little on the small side & tight but overall like this product a lot!": "5", "Great shoes, especially if you're on your feet all day. They're cute too! I also purchased them in white.": "5", "These clogs are so cute! Yes, they are wide, but that's the style. They are like walking on clouds.

My friend had a pair on and I fell in love and had to have my own. They are a little stiff but I'm sure will break in over time. I'm a 9.5 and bought the 8/9, which fits perfectly.

His joy filled face was worth it all. The perfect in-between of a clog and sandal, the Adilette is superbly made and comfortable. FIVE STARS!": "5", "They are NOT what they look like on screen. If they would photograph them on a different angle you'd be able to see.  It's a huge front, like a croc but even bigger.  Looks like a clown shoe.": "1", "If they didn't take a month to get here I would order another pair": "5", "Slappin Croc with these.  Sleek and comfortable. Can be work day night socks no socks. Cute colors. They sell out fast.": "4", "To the powers that be, please offer this in many additional colors. Very comfortable, a tad too wide but since unisex sizing, I'm sure that's why. I bought them because they weren't crocs :-) and genuinely like them. Received many compliments on them. Make more Adidas! I need some with studs!": "4", "Cute shoe.  Super wide, but for some reason this shoe is not comfortable on my toes.  It seems to rub my toe nails which I keep short.  I run, do yoga, and other activities so I have to keep my toe nails short.

Very comfortable and just cute.": "5", "Nice..............................................": "5", "Brought for my granddaughters for Christmas they love them.": "5", "When I first put them on the feel was different than a normal croc.

So I was surprised when these arrived and I tried them on for the first time. They're cushioned, but still supportive. The band around the foot also has some padding to increase comfort and reduce chafing. What you end up with is the classic Adilette design, just more comfortable. You can't really argue with that.

Perfect feel, perfect fit and so comfortable.": "5", "It's great quality, very true to size, and fits perfectly (a little snug with socks at first). It is a bit stiffer and not as soft as my older one, but it might just need time to be broken in. Hopefully the outer layer doesn't peel in the same way as the older one. I purchased 4 for myself and my whole family.  Either way would highly recommend!": "5", "Love the look and super comfortable. Would definitely recommend": "5", "Very comfortable for my husband and he loves the look of them": "5", "Love the color and the pattern. A great addition to my summer shoe collection.

However, when these arrived, I realized that Adidas has designed a more comfortable version of their classic slides. These ones have a soft, cushioned footbed and a strap with a bit of padding so it doesn't irritate the top of your foot. I bought these to be my everyday house shoes, since classic slippers are usually too hot for me to wear. I can say that they fulfill their role perfectly. I put them on when I get out of bed, and unless I leave the house (which is a far less frequent occurrence these days with the pandemic), they usually stay on until I get back into bed at the end of the day.": "5", "My husband was so pleased with how quick they got here.

They are very comfortable.": "5", "Super comfortable love the color fits perfectly I recommend 100 percent": "5", "Very comfortable and true to size. Will probably buy another pair to keep around.": "5", "I had to exchange my first pair because the instructions stated to go down a size for women. But it ended up being too small. I submitted my exchange for a bigger size and it arrived before I had the time to drop off my original order. Thanks!": "5", "Just as always , they are the most comfortable and most durable slides one can own in my opinion . Simple and practical like always !": "5", "The best  and comfortable people should buy more of theses.": "5", "I love wear slides.

I loved.last day I buy again": "5", "This product is nice and comfortable. I do recommend it!": "5", "I buy these slides about once every year or two for the past 20+ years.

The photo showed a us flag on the foot strap. What they send you is a blue and white strap, not what they imply they are selling.": "2", "Use these for the gym and they're perfect!  Dry quickly and they're comfortable": "5", "I Love them and they are so comfortable to wear anytime": "5", "The quality is without a doubt very sport and complex.": "4", "My first pair is more than 10 years old.  I wore them almost daily around the house as slippers and in warm weather out in the garden and out in the community.  They are still in great shape, but because they are showing a bit of wear, I purchased a new pair, same size as the old.  I am a female who generally wears a size 8 and 1/2 wide, so I purchased a size 7 mens which works very well.": "5", "If you are even a casual lifter, these shoes make a huge difference in stability and power over cross-trainers.": "5", "Bought these on a recommendation from my son who has an older pair and loves them. This is my first lifting shoe and they provide a stable platform without being too stiff. I was able to use on other leg exercises without a problem (lunges ect). Fits true to my normal size 10. Leg day just became a little easier!": "5", "This shoe exceeded my expectations, I never had a weightlifting shoe and I thought they would be uncomfortable but boy was I wrong. Also the depth I was able to achieve in a squat without feeling tightness in my hips or ankles is phenomenal. Please do not use the recommended size chart adidas provides. These shoes run true to size and if anything I would suggest getting a half size bigger for a touch more toe room. I usually wear an 11.5 and I purchased a size 12 and they fit perfect.": "5", "I've been looking for the best squat shoe for a while now. And this is the best one for that! And still has some flex ability for more dynamic weightlifting!": "5", "A VERY GOOD SHOE FOR SQUATS AND PRESSES. I ALSO USE THEM FOR DEADLIFTS FOR THE STABILITY.": "5", "Look no further... the holy grail is here.from the top too the bottom perfect": "5", "Great fitting shoe. Has more cushion on the heel than other lifters which is nice. Light weight too.": "4", "Very good product": "5", "I had the first version of the power lifts and this 2nd version has a better more elevated heal lift to get a good deep squat with good form!": "5", "Great support and comfort, exactly what I was looking for": "5", "These shoes are completely fine to use but have negatives that impact it. These shoes are very flexible and are not very rigid, which I dislike. They also made the shoes have the front lip curve up which make them more comfortable but less supportive. They also changed the bottoms of the shoes so the front and back of the bottom of the shoes have this knurling that is suppose to help with grip but if those sections get dusty it can cause more issues. They did lower the strap slightly which is extremely nice.These will work for people with wider feet. They are also feel very light.": "1", "These shoes are comfortable. I love the way they look. The fit is perfect for my feet size.": "5", "Immediately had gains. Stable heal, comfortable, grip, and great range of motion in the toes. I have wide flat feet and they fit perfect. Typically wear 12 and 11.5 running shoes. I ordered 11.5.": "5", "Good shoe very good overall feet don't slip very flat": "5", "Love these shoes! Best shoes for squating!! I wouldn't buy any other shoe moving forward!!": "5", "I love how they feel when I'm squatting . Can't wait to do some cleans in them": "5", "I use these shoes for weightlifting workouts and they really help, plus I get lots of positive comments on the great color.": "5", "I am inlove with these shoes. The way they feel and move makes squatting effortless. Much more mobility and overall better form. They're super light, so walking in them is not a hassle at all! I would recommend this shoe to anyone who is serious about lifting.": "5", "This is my second Adidas lifter purchase in 10 years. The first pair served me so well that I came back for an upgrade. A solid shoe for all that squatting, snatching, and cleaning.": "5", "Solid shoe, tried em on while sitting and could immediately feel the sturdiness. Foot felt planted to the ground. They didn't feel as dramatic as I was thinking they were going to, I was thinking my whole squat was gonna feel awkward or different but nah, just a solid squat shoe. And they look good too so that's an added bonus": "5", "I love these lifters! I had been wearing a different brand and a teammate suggested I get some Adipowers. Holy moly, I hit my squat without falling forward. They're awesome!": "5", "Love the color and look to the shoes but above all the comfort and feel of these shoes while lifting is amazingly comfortable.": "5", "Bought these to help do front squats and get better leg drive on the bench press and made it feels good": "5", "They were very good to do squats in. Very sturdy. Great materials": "4", "Great fit, love the design overall,  makes all the difference in the weight room having these for support.  Would highly recommend and go a half size bigger than your normal shoe size.": "5", "Great shoes that really help with getting low on squats and keeping form right": "5", "Versatile shoe that you wont regret buying. Extremely comfortable to get you through your whole workout": "5", "I was recommended this shoe by a friend at the gym.  My lower back had been hurting and he suggested I give those shoes a try.  While they are not the most comfortable shoes (mine run on the smaller side and are on the narrow side as well), it forces the lifter to keep good form during squats and deadlifts.  The elevated hill reminds you to watch your back and the knee angles.  I would definitely recommend these shoes.": "4", "Definitely the support and flexibility where you want it when lifting weights. Awkward to walk in but perfect for their intended use, lifting.": "5", "Quality is horrible comfort is okay but they're very wide and run larger than expected.": "2", "Good shoe for the price. A lot of ankle support which is great for lower body exercises": "5", "I have wide feet so they're narrow but I haven't found any lifting shoes for wide feet specifically so these work perfectly": "5", "Owned quite a few pairs of different brands and styles of lifters, these are by far the best I've owned.": "5", "My very first pair of lifting  shoes. Definitely worth the cost and fits very nicely!": "5", "I got this shoe primarily for heavy squatting and out of any lifting shoes I have ever owned this definitely feels the best. The heel is the perfect height, offers a ton of grip and stability. My only issue with the shoe is the upper which honestly feels a little cheap for a 180 dollar weight lifting shoe. I am concerned with durability but for now the shoe is comfortable and works great.": "4", "Although a bit narrow, the grip and heel in the shoe work perfect together.": "5", "I bought these shoes to improve my squats. I had a pain in the left knee during squatting. I used only small weight because I didn't want to destroy my knee. Once I started to use these lifting shoes my knee doesn't hurt me, and I can lift more weight without pain. Also, they allow me to better focus on the  control the movement. By the way, they are good too for cleans&jerk and snatches.": "5", "I had to order a half size up from my previous adidas lifters, the toe area is a bit narrow but the material is soft which allows for stretch so they are comfortable.": "5", "Currently my new workout shoe and I'm very impressed with the stability and performance it offers. Really loving the all white with black stripes. Beautiful shoe!": "5", "This product was not the size as indicated when purchased. Much too big": "1", "I tell you what boy if i lifted weights these would be the shoes id wear": "5", "You can tell the difference between chuck taylor and weightlifting shoe. Great investment.": "5", "Good quality construction and light weight. Great lifting shoe overall.": "5", "They look good, feel good, and give me the lift I wanted while not feeling heavy and they breath better than anything else I have tried. I love lifting in these and feel really stable.": "5", "If you need a shoe that fits well and will keep your foot stable, these are your new go-to. Absolutely love these things!": "5", "High quality product. Very sturdy and high quality.": "5", "Had been hesitant to buy lifting shoes for some time now, and now I'm wondering why! Such a great purchase and love the quality of adidas": "5", "Holy cow!  I've lifted so many pounds with these shoes!": "5", "The strap that locks the foot down tore off of the shoe completely after my 2nd workout. Literally wore them for less than an hour in total between my two workouts. Defective product": "1", "The shoe is extremely comfortable and light. The weight of the shoe is in the heel, making front squats and back squats easier to handle.": "5", "The size was perfect! I was worried that it might have been too big or small but it fit just perfectly. I use it for squats mainly and it's been helping me to go deeper, which was the reason I got them in the first place.": "4", "I purchased these as my first pair of lifters. They are true to size and made very well. They are comfortable to lift in. An excellent buy!": "5", "Great shoes, perfect for squats and Olympic lifts!": "5", "Great training shoes, perfect for squats and powerliting!!": "5", "These are my first pair of lifting shoes and they fit and feel great during barbell squats and Deadlift and even when I'm getting leg drive during a bench press.": "5", "Great, a must buy for Weightlifters. A little heavy but hey it adds more weight for those calves": "4", "I love these because of the look but I  thought they were going to be thin and flimsy but they are a very supportive,  strong, great quality shoe.": "5", "Comfortable. I can walk in them yet still provide the support needed. Colors are great. This is my first repeat purchase of a brand and style in lifters. Keep yp the good work.": "5", "They are comfortable and fit perfect, great for leg day": "5", "I couldn't get my squat max to move,  these helped me tremendously.": "5", "Perfect fit. Quality is super durable. The heel feels SO SOLID in the bottom of the squat. Truly a great shoe!": "5", "Bought a pair for my husband and me. We both love these for squats!": "5", "These shoes are awesome. Great comfort and awesome heel lift.": "5", "Great shoes. Definitely a upgrade from my Powerlifts 2.0.": "5", "so comfortable, could've been better if they hold my feet more firmly.": "5", "I am new to olympic lifts and wasn't sure I needed to purchase shoes quite yet. I noticed a big improvement in my ability to get out of the hole when wearing these shoes. They are strange to get used to since they aren't like any shoe I have worn before. I am very excited about continuing to progress with lifting!": "5", "This was my first time purchasing and wearing  a shoe that is made just for weight training. It has an interesting feel to it, almost heavy. Problem is most of my classes i attend are not only weight training and are a mix of cardio + weights. So for that reason I've realized it wasn't a wise choice to get this shoe. I'll probably use it on days that I do weights only. Otherwise, it's an excellent show for your weight only days.": "4", "I got a bunch of compliments on these when I wore them to the gym. Great fit and comfortable. Exactly what you'd want from lifters.": "5", "I really like this product stylish for sneakers at all": "5", "LOOKED GOOD ON LINE BUT PERFORMED HORRIBLE FOR ME. NOT GOOD IF YOU HAVE FLAT FEET": "3", "I bought these for my 17 year ild daughter who does basic barbell strength training. Squat, deadlift, press, power clean.She was wearing a \"deadlift shoe\" for all her lifts and made the transition to the adipower shoes easily.She has an average width in female shoes and these fit quite well.": "5", "Easy to hit depth with the heel offset, easy on the ankles. Very stable throughout the Olympic lifts and squats": "5", "7/8\" effective heel height. Material is what you would see typical of SNEAKERS and not weightlifting shoes. As a result, the shoes have too much flex. A weightlifting training shoe should provide stability, yet this shoe seems to want to flex in every way possible. Design also seems to show a lack of inspiration. Heel hoop strap is completely unnecessary and chafes back of feet occasionally. Colorways that are available also don't make a whole lot of sense. Why have black stripes on a black shoe? I would assume you would want your company logo to stand out? This shoe was clearly not designed with weightlifters in mind. I honestly wish Adidas would go back to their older design philosophies.": "2", "It's my first time purchasing a powerlifting shoe and it's amazing!! It literally boost my stability and power.": "5", "Perfect shoes for squats. Really helps with balance.": "5", "These feel very comfortable on feet with the padding all around the shoe and that look great. The only thing is that the right shoe is a little loose. I'm not sure if that's due to my foot or the shoe itself. Otherwise, great shoe!": "4", "Good general gym shoe for squats and whatnot. Only gripe is that the green fabric on the inside is visible through the white upper.": "5", "These are not my first pair of weightlifting shoes, but they are my first pair of Adidas weightlifting shoes and I must say, I am very pleased with the comfort, sturdy feel and the true to size fit. I use them exclusively for squatting and, as expected, they work as any proper weightlifting shoe would. But, these shoes differentiate themselves with superior build quality and comfort.": "5", "Great for Squats and Deadlifting. The balance in these shoes is superb. Only negative is that they don't allow much breathing so feet typically get hot while wearing them.": "5", "Good product to use at the gym and for squatting in general.": "5", "I liked mine so much I got a pair for my lady!  I've been breaking them in and so far so good. Stylish for sure.": "4", "It is good for lifting workout but is not suitable for workouts where you need to bend your feet": "5", "I've never used a lifting shoe before, and this one is great. It locked you into the floor so you can squat deeper too!": "5", "Quality, comfortable, Not true to size, order 1/2 smaller than your regular size.": "5", "This is my first pair of weightlifting shoes and to tell you the truth, they're pretty great. The shoes feel comfortable and im actually able to walk around the gym with them. I do hate the fact that the shoe laces can fray from the velcro stray so be careful.": "5", "Solid sole provides great support when working out": "5", "I really like these shoes. They are light enough to carry in a gym bag easily but provide a ton of support for heavy lifts. Definitely a game changer!": "5", "Right out of the box the upper material was nice and soft and offered a great fit. Sizing wise I stayed true to my other adidas shoes. It fit perfectly. Width wise was good as well. As much as I would prefer it a little wider, this was the average width and I don't have any stability issues with these. I mainly use them for Oly lifts and they do the job well. The sole under the ball of your foot has a good amount of flex as well so you can do some other stuff in them if necessary. If you are a crossfit person, I even tried jumping rope in them and they worked just fine. The velcro strap in the midfoot really locks your foot in for some added stability, although I don't use it from time to time. The laces offer more than enough. I've been using them consistently for about 4-5 months now and they barely show any signs of wear. Only negative, and it's so small it really doesn't matter, is that if you aren't careful the laces can get stuck in the velcro strap and it will snag/fray the laces. Not a big deal, just be aware. Overall, I'm extremely happy with these and am already considering getting another pair. Not because I need them, just because the other colors look so dang good.": "5", "It really adds confidence when lifting heavy! I didn't think a shoe could aid so much when working out than this shoe. It gives a stability that helps prevent injury and promotes a safe lift.": "5", "Truly helped my form immediately and I was able to lift heavier": "5", "These were exactly what I was looking for. I could not be any happier. I have a pretty wide foot so I was a little worried. And though they are a little snug that is kind of the point of these shoes. Definitely come in handy while working out. Very happy love the material and quality of the product.": "5", "Good Looking but not comfortable to keep on if you are finished squatting": "3", "Felt locked down when performing Olympic lifts. Was able to easily transition from my old lifters which finally gave out after 6 years. Highly recommended": "5", "They fit like a glove and feel so stable with squats! I didn't know weightlifting shoes could be so comfortable!": "5", "These fit and feel great while lifting. Very stable and look good too.": "5", "Pefect size, hard midsole, reasonable priceI recommend this shoes for powerlifting squat and strict press": "5", "Defientely felt difference lifting using these shoes versus previously using flats. The elevated heel feels great and the lockdown is solid. Would recommend to any serious or moderate level lifters as squat shoes.": "5", "Just as good a shoe as my first pair of Adipowers. Comfortable,  stable, and well built. Get a ton of compliments on the color (blue)!": "4", "These shoes look and fit great. Pretty comfortable for running errands and day to day wear.": "4", "This was a great shoe and a great take on an old classic.": "5", "These are an improved design and fit over my earlier pair. They are now a pleasure to wear during training.": "5", "Great first weightlifting shoe, due to its flexibility it's a great bridge between regular trainers and a more rigid pair of weightlifting shoes.": "5", "These are my first pair of squat shoes and I couldn't be happier with them. They make the biggest difference to my form and changed my squat for the better! They are lightweight and not restrictive at all. I have an old foot injury that causes my left foot to swell and i was worried the shoe wouldn't fit that foot well but it does! The fabric of the shoe is great! I went down a half size under the advisement of a trainer who has these and said they run slightly big. I'm usually a size 8 1/2 but i got an 8 and they fit perfectly. I would love to see some replacement soles that i could purchase in the future!": "5", "I recommended this for wide feet people, it is very comfort and flexible.": "5", "My foot is measured at 4E width. That is double wide. This leaves me with very, very few options with athletic shoes. Most court shoes in widths are made for older players, and I have literally slid to a stop to end up on my back in them.The Ubersonics wide toe box allows me to get away with a regular width court shoe after placing a slightly thinner insole into it.All that said was for the purpose of saying just how great these shoes are. I play very hard and fast. Pickleball requires a lot more bursts and stops and not once have I slid in these shoes. At 5'9 215lbs running a 4.6 I absolutely abuse shoes. I usually see wear on them in weeks. These look brand new out of the box after a month, my ankles are supported and I have no fear of playing aggressive. I have never written a review for a shoe but this one really deserves it.": "5", "perfect fit for best tennis. cushions are excellent making the foot very comfortable during the match": "5", "Felt great to play in nice strong support in sole explosive with an all around strong fit": "5", "Really love the way this shoe looks and super comfortable but had to return and the width was far to narrow for my foot.  (I don't have a wide foot) Would like to see adidas make a wider option.": "3", "Perfect fit and comfortable I like to wear as everyday shoes very light not like my old barricade.": "5", "I needed a pair of shoes for tennis and these were highly recommended. Now I recommend them too!": "5", "Nice Fit. Nice Color.Fits well and has very good comfort.": "5", "The insole doesn't have adequate arch support for me.  The insole needs a metatarsal pad as well.": "5", "I can cover the court really quickly in these shoes. They fit great, easy on and off. Glove like feel. Surprisingly durable. I bought 4 pairs to keep some for later -5.0 NTRP Men's player": "5", "These fit much larger than other Adidas of the same size. I 6 pairs of other tennis shoes and running shoes such as the Adizero, Adios, Boston, etc... and these fit large for some reason. I love all of the other Adidas products I've purchased and they all fit very well but these are way too large for some reason.": "2", "I think that when you lacquer it will be more comfortable": "5", "I grew up on barricades and this is the closest I can find, but it's not the same. Slightly too narrow (seems to be improving with some serious breaking in) and the material used in the inner is a bit rough, so I've had some issues with irritation but again that seems to be improving after playing a full match in them.": "4", "Great look and traction. It might be my foot, but it's tight where my foot flexes behind the toes. The top of my foot is steep which may be causing it. Didn't have that issue with my previous Ubersonics. Hoping it breaks in a bit.": "4", "Good balance of style and quality. I even wear them off the court. Feels like they'll last for years.": "5", "Flawless design, ankle area could use more support": "5", "Toe box area had too many pinch points. Good cushion.": "5", "good but a little small to large, i recommend a 1/2 up": "5", "A little tight in the front. I'm not recommend  this product.": "3", "Cool Looking and comfortable. Fit is as expected.Quality product.": "5", "Tennis has been my activity of choice, lately.  Because of my increased playing time, I wanted to have a shoe that was stylish, and able to endure intense games on outdoor courts. This model is everything I could have asked for. I'm used to Boost cushioning, but the LIGHTSTRIKE offered in this shoe didn't disappoint at all. I felt confident making hard cuts and stops because of the shoe's stability, and the sole.  I love that I don't have to sacrifice comfort to in order to have a rugged shoe. Can't wait to get out on the court again!": "5", "Love the shoe super comfy and responsive, was hoping they would be a little lighter than they are but I guess they need the weight for the stability and structure": "4", "I know this shoe is a tennis shoe but I bought it with intention to use it for outdoor basketball. The shoe is a nice looking shoe in person; lightweight and fits comfortably.I would say, like the reviews I watched, the forefoot area has little to no cushion. But switching out the insole for one of my better cushioned insoles, the shoe felt a lot better.I think the shoe would be a great shoe for tennis, and I know for a fact that it's a great outdoor basketball shoe.": "4", "Right out the box and onto the court, moving to every ball without missing a beat. No break in needed!": "5", "These fit my foot so much better than the SoleCourt Boost. (Those were too wide and long.) These 4's fit like a glove giving me confidence in all movements.Pro's: light weight, traction A+, Lightstrike cushioning is as good as boost (no knee pain).Wish I could get more pairs as backups for the future.": "5", "Was converted to the Ubersonics with version 2, liked but didn't love v3, and now v4 has arrived I can give it high marks. Nice \"squeeze\" in the heel and mid-foot area, foot doesn't feel squirley. And just enough space in the toe-box so you don't feel jammed in there, but also not floating in space. Super light and excellent cushioning. Good grip on the court. Two things to note, 1) I have wicked high arches, and don't feel the need to jam some wedges in there to support my feet, and 2) I ordered down 1/2 size to find my good fit.": "5", "Highly recommended, great look and really comfy I will get it again": "5", "Takes some time to break them in. But once it's done, pretty solid tennis shoes.": "5", "I don't love them as much as the 3s... worn only twice so far, and they feel constricted a bit in the toe box. They look nice, I just don't find them As comfortable as the Uber sonic 3s": "4", "Great all round feel,  size fits perfect and the sole looks like it will last a decent amount of time! Also looks so cool!": "5", "Solid Tennis/Squash/Platform Tennis shoes. Comfortable, good sturdy bottoms. Wear well and can endure some good play time. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.": "5", "This is a very comfortable shoe. The only thing that I don't like is that the toe box seems to wear down a little quickly. I've only hit for about 10 hours on it and I have lots of scuffing on the toe box. I previously played with the Ubersonic 3 and they had a bit more durability. I cannot say for sure how they will hold up long term, but either way I would still strongly recommend them to anyone!": "4", "I usually love Adidas court shoes, specifically Ubersonics, but these are not good at all. I have rolled my ankle 9 times in one month of owning the shoes. I would very much not recommend these shoes. They are way too tight and have too much traction to the ground which makes it impossible to move with them.": "1", "The color and design looks good on the court glad to see adidas making these eye catching designs and colors they stand out on the court great cushion and traction": "5", "There unique shoes with the design n the comfort level on my feet was great": "5", "This shoe has amazing arch support and hugs your foot well. When jump cutting and stopping quick you feel your foot stick to the court. I love these shoes.My one con is that I am a toe dragger and within 20 wears I have worn a spot on the toe.": "5", "Stable and nimble the way a tennis sneaker needs to be": "4", "Very good performance on court and extremely comfortable.": "5", "Definitely a solid shoe for playing. Feet got sore after long days in shoe. I am an aggressive mover on court, so upper durability was a bit lacking.": "4", "These shoes caressed my feet. I have slightly wide feet and yet the shoes came over and just fit snug. The arch support you receive from this shoe is incredible. It really adjusts to my middle-aged self. I also adore the style and design of the shoe. Although it looks a tiny bit clunky, the shoes were lightweight and my feet really desired these sneakers.": "5", "I got these to play sports on a grass field and they are perfect. They were true to size and are great quality. I got a size 10.5. If you have a wide foot check the width before ordering.": "5", "Buuuut I was wrong- very stable with spring. The fit is perfect around the heel so you can hit the turns with no issue. Its a little larger so order your reg size if you like the room.Def recommend.FL": "4", "Using them strictly for gym and exercise purposes, they offer great support especially in the heel and ankle area. I love the look of them too.": "5", "Bought these for my trip to Maui, wore them for 7 days straight, that included walking, hiking, running, sometimes even in the water. I'm used to the comfort of Nike Air Max's, so I didn't have high expectations, but these are so comfortable, I'm thinking about buying more in different colorway.": "5", "Love these adidas bounce I just kill my workouts in them!!!": "5", "My pair came in dirty on the bottom like it has been worn. It was already tied to someone else's preference and it was a mess inside the box, but still an awesome shoe. Would give 5 stars if mine came in clean.": "2", "I overpronate and this shoe is the best that I have had in years. Comfortable and supportive.": "5", "I wear these shoes daily for sprinting at track practice and they have a superb fit and responsive cushioning.": "5", "Overall a really good shoe. And I'm very satisfied.": "4", "Very good shoe for running and for casual wear. Look great, and feel great. They are really big for me though, that is the only problem, but I can still grow into them so its not that big of a problem.": "5", "I went a full size down and there was still a bit of space in front of shoe which caused some creasing. Other than that the shoes look amazing and feel very comfortable.": "4", "Glad I got these because these are super comfy. Great for standing and walking majority of the day": "5", "Awesome purchase. I bought these a month ago and have worn them about 5 times already. I enjoy walking around with them and definitely rival Nike airmax shoes in comfortability. These look awesome with Adidas Climacool sweats. I walk about 6-8 miles a day due to my job and I can head to the gym right after with these shoes no problem. Very affordable and I always get great feedback from my co-workers. Very simple design yet they get the job done. Adidas stepping up their game.": "5", "Excellent shoe! My son and I have this shoe in different colors and we both love them!": "5", "I normally wear 9.5 mens size UB, and decided to try the AlphaBounce to wear more for exercise, mainly footwork in martial arts. Lateral movement was no problem. I have to say, these fit TTS, especially having wide feet. Wearing the 9.5 size is perfect, if not a little bit more snug than the UB. Just enough room in the toebox, and the mid fit is not very narrow, it fits like a glove for me. If you don't want to drop $ for UB, go for the Alphas instead. Wore them all day, comfortable 100%": "5", "Great shoes! They look nice and feel good to wear.": "5", "So light weight with great performance!!!!!!!!!!!!": "5", "Great shoes totally recommended them. Only thing is that the white mesh are hard to keep clean other than that great buy.": "4", "Very good stylish pair of shoes. I could wear these with anything and use to the gym. Have nothing bad to say about them at all. Love the shoes": "5", "Got these on sale. I had low expectations, but these are super comfortable and feels like the soles are actually bouncing your feet off the ground. All in all great buy.": "5", "Have been pretty satisfied with the shoe and its aesthetics. Easy on and off, light with excellent flexibility. Use for weightlifting and casual wear. Like the heal stability and support. Warning, the upper is neoprene and they will get dirty quickly. Knowing that, go for it!": "4", "This shoe is amazing, I fell in love with it instantly. The pictures do not do this shoe justice. It is the most comfortable shoe that i have ever owned. It is super light, comfortable, breathable, and looks great. I initially bought it for running and it is the best running shoe, especially for the price point. I have also worn in casually and i get a lot of compliments every time i wear them. I bought them a half size smaller and they fit perfectly. Best bang for your buck.": "5", "This shoe was on sale for about half the retail price so I had to buy. Super comfortable and responsive. However, if you want a breathable shoe, this may not be for you. The base material is neoprene (think wetsuits) and this keeps your foot warm. This was actually a bonus for me, as I live in a colder area (30-40 degrees F.) and these keep my toes nice and warm. Just giving a heads up": "5", "Very comfortable, beautiful, great for running or casual wear": "5", "They get dirty too fast and they don't look like the pictures.": "2", "I absolutely love the shoe but I have one complaint. The shoe gets dirty very easily. After one light wear, there was already a buildup of dirt on the shoe. I would recommend getting a darker color so dirt isn't as noticeable.": "4", "I bought these because of the price at first and because they are super comfy. They are not the walking on clouds comfy, but they are a firm support comfortable.": "5", "These shoes are 100% amazing. They are a a great alternative to the boost if you don't want to spend 180 dollars. These are great shoes for working out or just wearing in general. The only downside is the grey colorway... They look more white than grey and the photo can be deceiving. Overall adidas is definitely winning with the alphabounce!": "5", "Great shoe; very comfortable. Beware of the gray ones, however. Make sure you see them in-store first. I bought them online without seeing them in person and the color is totally different than in the picture. That is my only complaint. I now have a different color and they are perfect shoes.": "3", "The Adidas Alphabounce has great comfort and are a very stylish shoe! What more could you ask for?!? I bought the grey pair while on sale and am also looking at getting the black/white/silver pair as well.": "5", "I can't wear these shoes the fabric is like a dirt magnet I cannot keep them clean": "2", "These are great shoes 10/10 would recommend to all.": "5", "Adidas has really stepped up, I love these shoes, I have purchased 3 different colorways, they are very comfortable for working out and just rocking whenever you feel like it. If they come with a black and red colorway I will get that next.": "5", "I bought a pair to do some weightlifting and running but I liked them so much that I made them into a casual shoe. I bought another pair on sale to be my workout shoe. It is supportive and the bounce is perfect for cross training. I hope they continue making this model!": "5", "I bought this shoe because I liked the way they looked and I have to say that they are really comfortable! I would rate a 5 out of 5 but I do not think they are as great as my pair of adidas Ultra Boost . I would just like to let anyone looking at this shoe please go into the store and try it on because it runs big. I usually wear a 10.5 and I bought it as a 10.5 but it was way too big.": "4", "I really like these shoes. What the other members say about sizing is correct. I followed their advise and I'm glad I did. Very happy with the shoes!": "5", "I was skeptical about these upon release. 2 chains was seen wearing then sold out everywhere & resale prices of $150 made me laugh. Finally, 5 restocks later, I had a coupon & WC reward so I spent the $70 on a pair. I'm so impressed with the comfort that I rank them ahead of nmd's but behind ultra boosts. Perfect daily kicks if you have back problems or are on your feet all day, etc. I'm a 12 & the Sz 12 was perfect, fit is TTS, width feels like it has play if your foot is wide. A+": "5", "These sneakers really stand out, they look so cool and casual, they run a tad bigger ,half size less will do. They are very comfortable they are also good for cross training ,but not for long distance running cause they weigh an ounce or two more.Love ,Love ,Love very hip .": "5", "Great shoe. Nice style. Price was right and I wear them 2x's a week.": "5", "These shoes are sharp..real head turners..these ran a bit narrow on my usual-size-9, so went up 1/2 a size to 9 1/2..yep, a tad long (no deal-breaker,for sure!) in the toe, but that's the cut of these shoes in this style...I've 3 pair in 9 1/2 and they're a Go! I do also have a pair of blue/orange/teal that fit perfect in a size 9..buyer beware of sizing between models, either way, you're getting a helluva bang for your buck at $100..These Adidas Blow Away my Nike AirMax '16's...'nuff said...": "5", "I typically wear a size 9 sometimes a size 8.5 for boots and running shoes. These shoes are great but I had to get a size 8. I purchased this shoes in a 9, 8.5, and 8. And i had to go with the 8. Both the 8.5 and 9 had a big gap of space near the toes.": "3", "Great shoe went with the print colorway. Crazy style and amazing comfort for just 100$ Are the major highlights in this show. Adidas is doing great things in the sneaker game. had to exchange for a size 11 after 11.5 was to big, I usually wear a 12 or 11.5 in most shoes Nike mostly 12, 11.5 in Roshe runs, def recommend picking up though for casual use or running/ working out A+": "5", "I went a half size up on these. Price and fit is great": "5", "Very stylish and super comfortable even without boost. Great price": "5", "Adidas is killing the shoe game right now and these just further cement their rise. These shoes fit true to size and are real comfortable. I can't tell how many people ask how they can get them.": "5", "I received my shoes via mail, was very happy with the style of the shoe. The right shoe is a 1/4\" longer than the left (both are marked as a size 12). I've worn a size 12 in every athletic shoe across brands and they're a bit on the larger size, even the left shoe. I'll be exchanging and hoping I get matched sizes.": "3", "Shoe is very comfortable. Size is tricky. I'm a wide footer and I had to go up from a 12 to 13. $100 spent on this shoe is 100% worth it.": "5", "Didn't get to buy these when they first released....glad they restocked. Was looking around & asking about the sizing, glad i ordered my actual size because i saw a lot of people saying go 1/2 size down but when i tried them on they fit perfect. i wear 11 in adidas ultra boost & 10 1/2 other shoes. stick with your size, great buy for the right price, comfortable & look dope, it'll make people turn their heads lol": "5", "My Son loves these shoes. He wanted me to buy them for him for the new school year. He has received many positive comments about these shoes and said people have askedwhere he purchased them from. He says they are very comfortable and loves how they look and feel.I would say they were a good buy.": "5", "As a sneaker head, wearing Jordan's or similar shoes daily can become uncomfortable. These shoes look and feel great and definitely then heads.": "5", "Most comfortable sneaker with heel support made. ..": "5", "These shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have owned. I use these for working out and gym class at the HS. The insole is padded very well and yes true to the shoes name there is a BOUNCE in each step.": "5", "Nice bounce to each stepBeautiful shoeComfortableNice neoprene materialPerfect for meLooks great too": "5", "comfortable & great! would highly recommend it, one of the best kicks i purchased this year": "5", "I own Ultra Boosts, Uncaged, and NMDs.I am on my feet 8hrs+ per day and these are BY FAR the most comfortable shoe out of the adidas line up (yes, even more so than ultra boosts).As far as sizing, don't listen to these other clowns - these are true to size.I ordered a pair in my true size and also a pair .5 smaller just because I was unsure and they are DEFINITELY TRUE TO SIZE!": "5", "I love these shoes because they r extremely comfortable and I also liked the design": "5", "I own Ultra Boosts, Uncaged but these for half the cost is amazing how comfortable the heel is.": "5", "Comfortable, light weight, and turns a lot of heads. A good grab for the price": "4", "I ordered the men's alphabounce black / purple gradient colorway and like the one of the previous reviewer's stated they tend to run a size big. I ordered a size 9 and am thinking of returning them for an 8.5.This shoe is comfortable as soon as I put them on. These alphabounces require no break in period. I am a die hard Nike collecter and these thare the first Adidas I've purchased in my adult life. I love the minimal 3 stripe branding.": "5", "AlphaBounce is a very comfortable shoe, I like these better the my Ultra Boost's by Adidas": "5", "Half size too big.Try on in store prior to purchase.": "1", "Firstly, the shoe runs big. I normally wear size 11. When i tried them on, i had a noticeable gap at the toe that creased when i stepped. I went down to the 10.5 and perfection.The overall fit is great, not too tight on certain areas like the uncaged. I wear them casually for long periods and are comfortable. Very lightweight and breathable.I dont intend on using them to workout but they feel sturdy enough to withstand more rigorous wear and tear.": "5", "Very comfortable and breathable running shoe. Fits pretty well, a bit narrow if anything.": "5", "I bought a pair of these shoes at a local sporting goods store. At first they were a little uncomfortable where the tongue met the shoe. After a couple of days the fit was perfect.  I wore these shoes at work 4 10 hour shifts per week. After about 2 months they developed tears on the ends of the toe piece on both sides. Was very disappointed because I loved the shoes.": "2", "Wild look that  some may not like but creative.Best thing about this shoe is the support from the heel arch counter. It cradles your foot extremely well and gives you confidence when moving.The torsion system adds to that so the shoe is well built.I like the translucent materials!!": "5", "I needed new walking shoes and saw the support for these and bought them. They fit my style of walking and it certainly has the support I needed. I would definitely buy these again when the time comes.": "4", "I used this shoe for walking and both shoes ripped.  Customer service still has not responded.  Never had adidas go out like that before.": "1", "Great shoes. I'm already looking forward for my next pair in a slightly different style.": "5", "How do we get our money back??? These shoes ripped within the first couple weeks.": "1", "These are absolutely without a doubt the most comfortable training shoes for the price. Dad bought these for me over Christmas and I wear them for track practice everyday. Nothing beats Adidas": "5", "Bought shoe to walk in and both shoes have ripped.": "1", "So good for training or walking, not the best shoes for running, are so hard....": "4", "I use them a couple times a week for the gym, I am still working them in but they look great!": "4", "Look good,  feel good,  good price through the outlet.  Can never go wrong with Adidas.": "5", "Love everything about the shoe except that it gets pretty narrow with little to no give around the bridge of the foot nearest my toes and where the laces end near the toe of the shoe. It is like a sturdy band around my foot pressing inward. It is the only area on the shoe that is snug and almost uncomfortable. the toes are fine and the rest of my foot is. It's just that one location. If it had a little more give, it would be perfect. Cannot get the next size up otherwise it would be too long.": "4", "The shoe itself is nice and the pattern is appealing .but the sole of the shoe could be better slip wise..The plastic on the bottom is slippery and useless..unappealing look wise.": "3", "Fits perfect! Super comfy": "5", "I wear these at work every day and they are very comfy. Great price and we'll worth the money.": "5", "Shoes are ripping  Where your foot naturally Bends . Poor quality Don't recommend buying them. The shoes are only 3 months old..": "2", "I wear these shoes everyday and they are very comfortable for my feet great if you walk everyday and the style is also very nice would buy this shoe again": "5", "I work in a liquor warehouse and I probably walk 5 miles a day, 6 days a week. I couldn't find one pair of shoes, that by the end of my shift each day, that didn't have my feet on fire until I found these Adidas AlphaTorsion 360's!! I only wish they had the black and orange ones in stock because I would buy 2 pairs of those as well.": "5", "I use them at work and i can wear them all day. Love them": "5", "Purchased these for my so, he gives them a thumbs up. Great quality, comfy and stylish.": "5", "Mt Son LOVED his Christmas gift! I will never forget tha smile he shot my way when he opened the box! Priceless!!": "5", "Good support, very stylish.

Thank you for your excellent service": "5", "Great quality, shipping was fast even though they say it might delay, size perfect and everything was perfect": "5", "Definitely a great addition to my shoe collection. Awesome design and great looking and comfortable pair.": "5", "The shoes are very comfortable . It's like soft pillows": "5", "A little snug,maybe order half a size bigger but great shoe overall.": "5", "I ordered this shoe because I love that the pattern and color scheme is different from most shoes. I work in a hospital average 8 hours a day some days around 10-12 hours. They were delivered to me on a Sunday and I worn them to work on the following Monday. The first thing that I notice was my shoes was a little tight around my toes, but I knew that they are new shoes and I figured that I'll give them a chance to break in. Well, I never gotten a chance to do that because on the third day of wearing them the bottom part of the sole started falling off. I was very disappointed in adidas because I own about 30 pair of adidas and this was the first time that I'd experienced something like this. Customer service was excellent though they emailed me a return label and  refunded my money immediately!": "2", "There's a part that is too small and makes it feel awkward": "3", "This shoe is the perfect training shoe but does have a slight arch in the sole. The tip of the shoe has rubber finished so your foot can't break through": "5", "Nice workout or everyday casual shoe. Great fit and cushion.": "5", "Very good but is small on wide but is very comfortable": "4", "I just love the look of these. They look so much better in person than they did online!": "5", "I am a gym rat, I go everyday to the gym. I do about 30 minutes on the stairmaster, 30 minutes on the stationary bike , and like 30 minutes on treadmill.  This shoes are perfect for my cardio activities.": "5", "I knew my size(9), so I've ordered it. However, I never noticed that the width of this shoe would be this small. It hardly squeezed my foot, so I couldn't walk well. I'm so disappointed with this product.": "1", "I'm a nurse and comfortable shoes are an requirement for me. So I can be comfortable walking and cute all at the same time.": "5", "Received my new pair and as expected it was a perfect fit and so comfortable!": "5", "It's not flexible, It looks big on feet, laces doesn't tired properly.": "1", "I have been loyal to adidas for 25 years. These shoes look great but are the most uncomfortable I have worn. Cut my heels. Rubbed skin off my toes. They were the correct size but just stiff with limited padding. Don't reccomend.": "1", "This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes i've worn in a while. I bought 3 other pairs prior and honestly i only want to wear these. AMAZING": "5", "I like the color of these and they're comfortable.": "5", "These Looks great and feels great. Wish i could find these in a different color so I could buy another pair.": "5", "This is the most comfortaboe shoe i have every had. Looks great and is very supportive.": "5", "Little pricey but very good quality. Get what you pay for.": "5", "The product has a unique look which helps you stand out from the crowd": "5", "Very modern that attracts many compliments, particularly the new age material": "5", "I ordered these in the same size that I regularly wear in many other Adidas shoes and I can barely even get my foot into these. If you have a wide or a tall foot, these are not for you. Other than that, the shoes look incredibly well made and the colors look way better in person than in photos.": "5", "This was a great purchase. They were affordable and very comfortable. They are very light and not a heavy shoe. I'm very pleased with my purchase.": "5", "They are extremely comfortable and light": "5", "My shoes don't look like the picture, all the same color orange.": "3", "This the perfect shoe for my workouts and regular wear": "5", "Outstanding color way, should be more colors. Great pattern, very comfortable. Contemporary colorway !!": "5", "Comfortable and sweet ghr didihh jdjdijhwkr riffjdj": "5", "It seems adidas is losing in quality of their product. I still love their iconic shoes.": "1", "Shoe is light and comfortable, but the upper does feel a little too like plastic when twisted.": "4", "Great design, excellent choice of color ways. Need more colors!!": "5", "Perfect fit, great price and very comfortable shoe": "5", "Really surprised by the support and sturdiness of this shoe. Makes a great walking/jogging shoe. Rigid at first but then very comfortable.": "5", "They are paper thin, you can see color of socks inside shoe and hand": "2", "Impeccable quality, very comfortable, great look, should be available in other vibrant colorways": "5", "Very comfy for running and has a sleek design. The bottom exterior design of the shoe is larger than what I usually wear, but it looks pretty cool.": "5", "Lightweight and comfortable. I feel like walking on clouds.  Highly recommended.": "5", "Adidas  brings yet another top notch  product. This is comfy  and hold your foot with security . I have had numerous compliments on this shoe . Do yourself a favor and buy this product": "5", "Coming from wearing NMDs and Ultraboosts for a while, I thought I'd try Torsion again. Hadn't owned a pair with any type of Torsion for YEARS. This isn't the Torsion I remember at all. This is definitely Alphatorsion!These are very light and feel sturdy and supportive. They're not going to give the same as Boost will, but do have a \"bounce\" to them. Best I can describe it is like a spring. It's responsive enough that you \"feel\" it. They feel good at the toe box, feel supportive at the arch, and pretty much hug your foot just enough. The mesh uppers let your feet breathe. The mesh allows some degree of \"customization\" based on the color of your socks, so keep that in mind if that type of upper isn't your preference.You get a lot of shoes for the price. I am absolutely satisfied with them, If I had anything to truly complain about it's that the tongue can be a bit \"floppy,\" but that's probably because my Ultraboosts have me spoiled with the one-piece design. All in all, great shoes! Might have to grab another pair later!": "5", "The design is great! I like to use them for long walks or speed training.": "5", "These shoes are so amazing and I am so upset that they decided to use Plastic/PU molding around the lacing closure, because it doesn't give at all, and it just dug into the top of my foot and hurt the whole time.": "1", "fits right. super smooth styling and ride.": "5", "I highly recommend these shoes as they are very comfortable and the look and design is amazing it goes well with everything": "5", "It's a fairly cheap shoe and it performed well. The comfort was not bad and it lasted for a decent amount of time.": "4", "Shoe looked nice online. In person it looks big and clunky. Feels big and clunky when walking in them too. Part of the shoe is already wearing on the side after only 3 months of use. Would not buy again": "2", "Perfect look, perfect feel, and perfect price. You will not go wrong with these": "5", "Love these, slightly big on me as I don't use socks, but super light": "5", "I've had these shoes for one month and the inside seam is split. These were an aboslute waste of money. Have had issues with other brands in the past never Adidas.

Comfortable and durable as well.": "5", "Comfortable enough to wear all day.

He wears an 8.5 in sneakers and they were true to size. He says they're very comfortable and has enjoyed wearing them during indoor baseball practice and training sessions.": "5", "I ordered for my son and when we opened them the stripes looked like glitter. We returned them.": "2", "These are very comfortable. Best baseball turfs on the market!": "5", "Big fan of adidas turfs and these also do not disappoint. I like last year's turfs a little better cuz I usually dont go for the flashy designs but these are still very nice and a good fit.": "5", "THIS IS SHOE IS LIGHT BUT STURDY FEELS GREAT LOTS OF ROOM AND PLENTY COMFORTABLE.": "5", "Ordered half a size up due to width. Shoe seemed tight at first while trying it on, but once I got my foot in the shoe, it fit perfectly. the traction is perfect for turf and hard packed dirt.": "5", "!!!!!!!!!! Very good!!!!!!   My son loves them!!!!!!!!": "5", "Great durable lightweight shoe for the cost. Fits well.": "4", "Good looking shoe.  nice style .  Light enough to workout and run in and sturdy enough for hardcore weights": "5", "The quality of the shoe is impressive, Looks good, the only issue with the shoe is the extreme narrowness of it!   I'd recommend a wide width or at least a size larger!  That option was not available when I purchased mine!": "1", "I bought these for my 11-year-old son. He broke his ankle couple years ago and ever since has a tendency to roll it on occasion. So they unique lacing system that is suppose to add stability interested me. He really likes these shoes and says they are comfortable.": "5", "I hope they get broken in soon because right now they are hurting my feet and I can't wear them for long periods of time.  I bought them to replace another pair of Adidas that I had for about a month and a half before they starting tearing in several places.  I like Adidas, but I wish I could have tried these on before I purchased them.": "3", "Everyone knows that a successful baseball season starts with your spikes.

Beautiful shoe.  But, as soon as i started walking around in them, they felt awful in the arch. The would make a noise and squish at the arch.

The only thing is that they were one size to small. He normally wears a size 10. When we received the size 10 they were way too small. Bought him size 11 and they are perfect.

So far so good": "4", "Comfortable shoeNice designStable for daily useGreat buy": "4", "Not the worst tennis shoe on the market but def not the best": "5", "The sole is a bit harder than other adidas, but is actually a good thing. Still comfortable. Is a good thing because once you start moving and playing,you can feel your feet have a solid grip and don't move inside the shoe and for some reason any move you feel safe and that this shoe will never let you down. That is doing what is supposed to.": "4", "I love these shoes and have been playing in them for a bit. They are lasting pretty well. It was weird adjusting to the sock fit but once you do they feel nice. Only problem I have had is I have to wear long socks with them or else I get blisters on my heel. This isn't a huge inconvenience now but it was when I started getting the blisters": "4", "About to buy my third pair, I play tennis a lot and they're very good.": "5", "Cool colors, awesome sole!! Good ankle support, would buy them again": "4", "Great for slightly wide feet.  Great tread for hardcourts.": "5", "Shoes are very good for an advanced beginner/intermediate in tennis. They do tend to run big, but after implementing a lace lock, they fit snug.": "4", "It's very comfortable in playing tennis in the hard court": "5", "I wish there was more cushion on the sole.  Quality and style are good.": "4", "Anyone who cares about light weight, good traction, lateral stability, out of the box comfort will like this shoe.": "5", "It is a little bit heavy, but over all it does well inside the court": "5", "Fits very well with good grip on hard courts. Good color  selection": "4", "Houdini would have a hard time getting into these shoes": "2", "Cool looking, thick soles, and comfortable. I play everyday and they are the best.": "5", "They are alright but fit fine but were just chunky fitting.": "4", "I am always stuck between buying a 12 or 13 size shoe,  due to the current reviews that suggested this shoe ran large I bought the 12,  I wish I had gone with the 13,  love the look, love the feel,  but when I play tennis the shoe is just slightly smaller and hurts my toe just a bit,  so don't go for the smaller size.": "3", "Really solid tennis shoes but already excited to move up a level in my Adidas tennis shoe game for on court performance.": "4", "A bit wide but good shoe,  comfortable and stylish. White color can get dirty but cleans nicely.": "4", "It would be hard to find a better shoe for the price.  A little wide in front and oddly had some pressure spot on my big toe (only in one shoe).  The problem resolved after about 30 minutes of playing.  Make sure the surface is completely dry or you'll be slipping all over a place.  Otherwise, very solid tennis shoe!!!": "4", "It was definitely worth the purchase, the quality was immaculate.": "5", "This tennis shoe is amazing. The hard rubberish material on the side is amazing and keeps the shoe from ripping. Im just going to buy this shoe over and over because its perfect.": "5", "Well made for the court. Great shoes. Would recommend for pickleball": "5", "I bought the same product $25 cheaper from other sellers": "3", "I bit the bullet and bought these after joining a league team and what a difference it makes on the court. I feel confident going for the balls without worrying about slipping like I did with my regular running shoes. They look great and are comfortable. Highly recommend if you play tennis on the regular!": "5", "Really good shoe, grips the court really well and lasts a long time.": "5", "A bit longer than other 10 1/2 Adidas that I've owned. Using for court - tennis, pickleball - great performance": "4", "Will know more after using a bit more, so far so good.": "5", "It is a great sneaker if you're looking for durability, but if you are used to light weight/running shoes, you aren't going to like the weight. But overall, they are great for Tennis. Also, you may want to consider going a size down, I went half a size down and it still had a lot of extra room.": "4", "I usually played in running shoes so this are not as bouncy-now I see the difference of control.": "4", "The feel of the shoe fit nicely, however, when moving around in them, I noticed that it was pinching my ankles. I had to unlace the top hole which led to an overall better fit.": "4", "Very comfortable and seems to be great quality product.": "5", "I only went half a size down. Im usually a 13 with Adidas skate shoes and did a 12.5 with these, shouldve done the 12 but they are fine.": "5", "Ole reliables and a good looking shoe, I love the simplicity of them": "4", "Great tennis shoes , cushion and fit. Color is beautiful": "5", "Great for hardcourts and use them at least three times a week.": "5", "I just got into tennis and turned to adidas because, well, of course they make a good tennis shoe! I got the shoe in white with the orange bottoms and they look amazing!! Not only that, but that have lots of traction and grip, and the outsole seems very durable -- much less worn after one session, compared to my running shoes. There comfortable and fit seems consistent with other adidas shoes I own.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and hope these shoes will last. Highly recommend!": "5", "i ordered this for my dad on fathers day and he loved it. he wants to order more": "5", "Love these shoes. I hope they are durable enough, the mesh gets dirty quickly, that is my only complaint.": "5", "They're comfortable and provide good court moevement.": "5", "These sneakers are very durable and comfortable for walking. They fit nicely!": "5", "I almost forgot what I ordered lol these came in the mail as a gift for my dad. So comfortable and more stylish than I expected.": "5", "I love the courtjam bounce! They feel great and look great as well, plus they hold up quite well!": "5", "works perfect for reason i purchased shoe for, hitting golf balls": "5", "Wore it to play tennis this morning for the first time and they felt great. Happy about my purchase. I might get in other colors. Very fast shipment too.": "5", "It is a good product.  It has all the qualifies that I'm looking for.": "5", "I like the style and color. Very fashionable, and some women really respond to it!": "4", "I've solo practiced with these for a few weeks now, hitting the court for live matches soon. I like the overall support they give, ordered 1/2 size larger for my arch inserts, and the fit is perfect for me. The \"coral\" color shown online is NOTHING compared to reality, so if HOT FLAMINGO is not your thing, well then...  but I expect some easy points off opponents when they are blinded or distracted looking at these!": "4", "I haven't worn them much yet because I'm trying to wear out my current shoes, but I threw these on when I got them, and they looked and felt great. Would definitely recommend!": "5", "Good value and comfort in tennis shoe. Third pair.": "5", "I ordered these a half-size larger to accommodate DrS inserts for more achilles protection, which I typically wear in all my tennis shoes. They feel great, not too loose with the inserts. They LOOK wide but foot feels supported and connected. Can't wait to try them out on the court. The \"coral\" color shown on website is nothing compared to the actual \"WOW! LOOK. AT. THESE. SHOES!\" electric shock tone - so if that's not your thing.... Otherwise, should be worth a few extra points as they blind your opponent from across the court!": "5", "Well made shoe. Unfortunately due to Covid I am unable to play tennis at the minute.": "5", "Fits well for hard to fit gentleman. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx": "5", "At first try, they seemed a little big in the toe box but turned out to be fine": "5", "good sneaker for the hardcourts easy on the dogs a lot of room for sliding": "5", "I like the colors the style. Nice pair of adidas shoes that I have been wanting.": "5", "Well first of all, the shoe is sexy. Second, it's super lightweight, breathes nicely, and fits my foot relatively well. It is SLIGHTLY wider than I would've liked, and I would've liked a little more arch support, BUT it's still a great shoe.": "4", "Great product excellent traction and support. I'm late 50's play tennis and paddle, this sneaker gives me support and confidence to push my game.": "5", "Very comfortable the shoe seems to be very durable and light": "5", "This product is amazing in all ways. On the court, and just in the public. The design of the shoe is nice and not too heavy. The comfort level is superb much better than any other brands. I can't wait to keep playing in these shoes.": "5", "I have had adidas many times for years, it's good to have another pair.": "5", "Good style and color balance. Like the splash of orange": "5", "Well made.  High quality. Colors stand out.  Extremely comfortable.": "5", "I play 2-3 times a weeks and I always played with regular light weight shoes made for walking or running but they would only last about 2-3 months.My doubles partner suggested these shoes because of the fit and how durable they are.  I finally gave in and bought a paid and they are day and night form regular shoes. These have a \"sock-fit\" which wraps your entire foot and provide extra grip on the court. I am a bet player who relies on quickness and these shoes give me the extra grip and support needed for qu ok sudden changes of direction I constantly make.I had the shoes for a month and the sole look as good as new. In comparison, a regular shoe I used to buy a pile be 30-40 percent worn down by now.I strongly recommend this shoe and plan to buy another pay soon so I can have multiple colors.": "5", "For my taste, the style of this tennis show is nearly perfect. There is almost nothing I would change. I also love the comfort and support of the tongueless sock-like fit. My only complaint with these shoes is the somewhat inconsistent construction and quality control.  When I realized how much I liked these shoes, I bought a few pairs.  Unfortunately, one shoe arrived with a noticeable scratch/flaw line that cut across the middle stripe on the outside of the left shoe. Of greater concern was the inconsistent construction of the main components.  Some shoes fit perfectly . . . comfortable, form fitting, no issues. However, some shoes pinched the heel tighter than others, and one right shoe had such a noticeable protrusion in the instep/arch area that it had to be returned.  This was not present in other right shoes in the same size.  So, in conclusion, I love these shoes and would highly recommend them . . . but you might need to try a few pairs before finding ones that made it off the assembly line just right.": "5", "I have 3 pairs of Adida's, size 8, and they all fit perfectly.  This particular pair felt like it was a size 7.5.  Sadly, I had to return them.": "2", "love the color and fit . so stylish and confortable": "5", "Comfortable and supportive fit.   Length was great.  It is slightly narrower but fits comfortable.": "4", "I should have ordered size 10 instead of 9.5 but they are working out okay!": "4", "I should have ordered 2 pairs! The fit is terrific and they look even better": "5", "The sock like fit made the width too uncomfortable to wear when unlaced.": "3", "Shoe is great for frequent tennis play. I play a couple times a week and haven't felt any degrading in the shoe or any pain in my feet after play. Would recommend!": "5", "I am a life longer Barricade loyalist.  They were the absolute best tennis sneakers for me.  These felt uncomfortable and low quality.  Not very \"adidas\" in my mind.": "2", "I own several pair of Adidas that include shoes for golf, running and casual. 9 1/2Is usually good, so I ordered these in 9 1/2. I would need a 10 and possibly 10 1/2 in these. The material and build quality all looks good.": "4", "Very snug, might make you sore around the ankles due to the fit, did for me. Hopefully when broken in they will be more comfortable.": "4", "Snug, so if you're between sizes pick the bigger one in my opinion.Smaller is still good enough, but close to too snug.I haven't used them much, but easy to move around": "5", "Comfortable but quite hard to put in the feet into the shoes": "4", "A very comfortable tennis shoe that responds incredibly well on court. Would buy them again.At first I ordered these on my usual Adidas size, but then I had to go half size larger. The toe box is slightly narrow and there's so much cushioning that they appear to be a bit small than true size.Go half size larger and you'll do just fine.": "4", "I find these to be the best pure shoes for tennis on the market": "5", "The shoe is well made overall. The fit I'd perfect. The inside liner wraps around my foot like a \"foot in glove\"": "5", "The shoes feel very light on court as well as being comfortable. I do think you should buy half a size smaller due to their length.": "4", "Already receives a few compliments on them after only a couple of uses": "4", "The defiant generation multi court is good looking shoe. Unfortunately, it is not made to fit my feet. It's a bit too tight across. The length was ok but overall the shoe didn't feel comfortable. Adidas Barricade fit my feet better.": "3", "The foot \"pouch\" comes up too high and is a bit too small.  Makes them difficult to get on and off.": "2", "Good stability on hard courts. Takes pressure off of knees.": "5", "Great tennis shoes! Perfect for competing on any court!": "5", "This is a good show for tennis. It has pretty good grip. I was in the market for a lightweight tennis shoe, and this isn't lightweight. But most importantly, it's ankle protection. Because my foot is locked in and doesn't slide up or down, the toe box works. Not a running shoe.": "4", "The fit is a little narrow for me, but that is because I have wide feet.  Otherwise its a great shoe, and provides ample grip and support.The green color looks really good as well..": "4", "Great for playing tennis! Can't wait to keep trying them on different courts!": "5", "Had high hopes for this shoe as a lightweight tennis shoe for indoor matches, but the fit is way to narrow (also had to order 1/2 size larger for length).  I have a narrow to med. foot shape, so I was thinking this shoe might fit well, but it is EXTREMELY narrow and tight.  Just slipping on and walking around house was painful.  Upper materials and sole looked to be high quality and durable, but I had to return due to poor fit. Perhaps if you have a super narrow foot this might work for you.": "2", "Really cool design with comfortable support. Might be the coolest pair of tennis shoes I've ever had.": "5", "This shoes has lots of support. Next time I would order .5 a size up.": "4", "The shoe is very, very comfortable. My foot slides into the shoe which immediately expands/contracts to fit perfectly.In addition, I love the styling.": "5", "The shoes are great and offer nice support. I will caution that I have had blisters on the outside of my heel on both feet while breaking them in. The heel cup is very rigid plastic. I think once they are properly broken in they will be perfect. Very snug.": "4", "I ordered my size and it was impossible to put on. It's too narrow. I have ordered one size bigger because I like the shoes.  Let's see if that fits. If it was a little wider I would give it a 5 \u2b50\ufe0f": "3", "Slightly more cushioned than regular tennis shoes. Have a great grip and your foot doesn't feel loose at all. Wouldn't recommend these for players with wide feet though.": "4", "Shoe feels solid on the court , with a good grip on the hard courts.": "4", "Shoes look great and feel good on foot. Might fit a touch large, especially in toe box. But with tight lacing I was all set. I'm a beginner player, but can say they feel fast and flexible.": "4", "light weight, no break in needed, and so far have held up very well after 40hrs on the court.": "5", "Looks good, feels very comfortable, and so far provide support and grip while in the courts.": "5", "Good style and comfort. First pair of tennis shoes.": "4", "I was wearing running shoes to play tennis and was straining my ankle. These shoes are perfect and so comfortable.": "5", "Slides well and eases the stress playing tennis does on your knees and feet": "5", "Light weight and amazing, perfect for running! I was unsure about buying shoes offline without being able to try them in and timely worked out great.": "5", "Great an comfortable, recommended for running. Easy to wear": "4", "The quality is so amazing it feels like you're wearing fuzzy socks. That goes to show how comfortable these shoes are.": "5", "Looks good but not enough support it's too light not good in snow needs more leather": "1", "Wear them all the time. Only now starting to lose their springiness almost a full year in.": "4", "So comfortable you dont even know there on your feet.": "5", "I bought this shoes for my son. He loves them. They are perfect and a good fit for his long feet.": "5", "These shoes are extremely comfortable and affordable.": "5", "Very comfortable and looks stylish and the colors are great": "5", "Very nice sneakers for every day!!! They feel very light in the feet": "5", "What this shoe lacks in aesthetics it makes up in comfort.  I wanted a cheaper pair of Adidas for the gym the days I don't use my Adidas Powerlift shoes.  These shoes are great for their intended use. Comfortable and light.Not aesthetically eye catching.  They do their job.": "4", "Not as comfortable as many Adidas are. Fine for hanging out but not for working out.": "4", "I thought I would try these for short time but there were terrible. Support is not enough so maybe just would be for leisure.": "1", "Comfortable and best signature style, always like to wear addidas": "4", "Best pair of shoes I've purchased for my feet.  I love my shoes and the price was great!": "5", "love, love ,love, love ,love . perfect, good     ,": "5", "I don't know, but it seems lately that Adidas has made their shoes with less tread or sole.  I mean, the sole is now about 1/8'' thin.  Yes, thin.  Adidas used to have running shoes that had a good tread, but now it is super thin.  By wearing these shoes jogging or active wear these treads wear out in about 2-3 months - NO KIDDING !  Is this some type of attempt for me to buy more shoes like 3-4 pairs a year ?!?!  Ridicuous.": "3", "Really good product and price. Great for all kinds of exercise.": "5", "One of the stripes was hanging off. I wouldn't recommend getting them online. Go to a store.": "2", "Great shoe, love the color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "5", "Fit perfect and so comfortable.

Did not give it 5 stars because I am yet to fully break them in.": "4", "Nice bounce to the heelVery light weight for comfortable movement": "5", "These shoes have a white/grey mesh material. One thing I would like for Adidas to add on any of there shoes are some care instructions (especially when they are white) since these can get easily dirty and can be annoying to clean. I had some water droplets from a puddle land on the shoes and left some brown stains which were unable to disappear. I was unable to remove the stains, but other than being picky about having them clean, these shoes look amazing. If you are a lot more careful about shoes than I am, I would recommend getting these!": "5", "I like them for running. They are comfortable and affordable": "5", "Duramo's are great shoes.

Will buy again!": "5", "Solid, workhorse type running/workout shoe that does what it says on the tin.

Thank you Adidas!": "5", "I bought myself a pair of these shoes before the holidays and wear them everywhere-they are do comfortable.  My son loves blue so naturally I bought him a pair.

I wish I could find those again": "3", "I needed a workout/gym shoe to replace the Adidas Shell Toe Superstars I've worn for years.  Now, I just wear those in the street.

They fit me literally right to the shape of my foot.": "5", "Great shoes.  Very comfortable.  Blue is my favorite color": "5", "Bought these shoes for at-home workout. I workout on a rubber mat over a concrete floor -- which does not always have the best give. These shoes provide great support and cushion, without feeling to pillowy.What I love most about these shoes are the laces. When I tighten each section of lace, I can get it just right and the laces don't move when I let go and move to the next set. This way I get the right amount of support for each part of my foot. This is great because a lot of shoes tend to cut the circulation off to my feet because the laces slip and tighten in the wrong spots, and when you are doing lots of squats with heavy weights, it becomes a problem real quick.Definitely worth the buy.": "4", "Good purchase at a good price!  Don't care for white but that is what my son likes.": "5", "I returned the item. I would not recommend this partial shoe. Go with an ultra boost instead": "2", "Excellent choice for running and overall everyday wear": "5", "They are very comfortable which is exactly what I was looking for.": "4", "These are nice shoes. I got them to work out in. I usually go for the ultraboost but decided to try these for a little more side support and they are just fine. My only complaint would be the tongue.

They seem to be well made so I hope to log plenty of miles in them.": "5", "Very comfortable and light..ideal for running or just lounging": "5", "There is good support for high arch.

I'm happy with my purchase": "5", "I like the color, comfort and more importantly satisfied with the purchase. Looks simple and good fit.

The shoes are incredible": "5", "These are an incredible steal. They are supremely comfortable, have incredible support, and hold up well under harsh miles (I put over 20 miles on them within two days). They run a little bit long, and slightly wide (my feet are wide and these don't pinch at all). I would recommend ordering half a size down.": "5", "So far, these shoes are exactly what I needed.

They are perfect for these uses. They are stylish, comfortable, lightweight, and fit perfectly. I normally wear a size 13 2E in athletic shoes but this size was not available so I went up to a size 14 D and the fit is great with plenty of forefoot room for my wide feet.

In that period, I've used them to walk on average 2.5 miles once per day about 25 times.The soles are already nearly worn out. I do not pronate and I'm not overweight but for whatever reason these shoes just have not worn well. Very disappointed.": "2", "These shoes were for my husband who works on his feet 8 hours/day. He also suffers from Plantars Fascitis pain and he has reported these particular shoes are the most comfortable ones yet. Even more than the previous Adidas purchase. Thank you for helping to make his work day comfortable. Please don't get rid of these.": "5", "This is about the least amount of money I'd pay for a pair of shoes, and they do the trick.

They are high quality and very cute.  The color is perfect.": "5", "I was going to use this shoe indoor training. Turns out that this shoe is great for indoor training.

He likes the style and comfort of these.": "5", "I've honestly never had such a light pair of shoes in my life. I was a little nervous when i picked up the box because it felt like there was nothing in there. When I opened up the box I could clearly see a pair of beautiful looking shoes in my size. Now, i have wide feet and it's different to find shoes that are as wide as i need them to be and these shoes arent available in a wide size so i have to loosen the laces so i can slip them on and off easily. I prefer slip-on shoes but I purchased a pair of shoes made with similar materials a few months ago and i love them. I tried to get a pair of shell toes a few weeks ago and they were so uncomfortable that I have no idea how i ever wore them in the past. These shoes really feel like the future of footwear that is as much about foot health as it is about style. I would give them 5 stars if they'd just make a wider size.": "4", "Nice shoes comfortable satisfying quality a little bit tight.": "4", "Outstanding fit and comfort. The off blue and grey complement everything from jeans to combat pants.

Great shoe and fast shipping.": "5", "This shoes look stylish but they are too wide and made of cheap material. I can tell they would not last long and I doubt they worth the money.

I normally do not do reviews.": "4", "Love that the shoe is made from salvaged plastic!!": "5", "My feet don't get sore after running and cushion the impact of every step": "5", "These shoes were falling apart after running with them for one week.  The stitching around the rubber is coming undone and the fabric is pulling away from the edges.  Definitely not running shoes.  Don't know how anyone can run with these.

I will have to shop around for better running shoes.": "1", "I decided to get these shoes as an introduction into the Parley technology.

These slides are that!": "5", "These are so comfortable I wear them around the house all day long!": "5", "Maybe I had my expectations set too high, but these are NOT anything like other boost shoes I've worn. The material is hard and not cushy. The strap over the foot is SUPER tight, like \"grab the slide with your hand and push it on your foot\" tight. The molding of the footbed also doesn't match a normal foot. Right under the strap, it feels like there is a bunch of raised material under the ball of your foot. Maybe the idea is that this area breaks down faster, so make that area more durable, but it ends up cutting off circulation to your toes. I don't have abnormal feet, so it's not my weird foot that is the problem. Thoroughly disappointed with these.

I wear boost shoes the other 10%.  As soon as body slides we released I had to get a pair.  Just like boost shoes they provide three best comfort and support of any sandals or slides I've ever tried... and I've tried a lot more varieties than the average person.  Sure there are cushier, softer, more pillow like sandals and slides like adilette comforts, which are great just to wear inside home, but these slides are made to be worn everywhere.  Wanna go for a 3 mile walk with you're dog?  No problem.  Wanna wear them with a button down shirt and khaki shorts to a local non formal restaurant?  No problem.  Wanna wear them to the beach?  No problem.": "5", "Very comfortable,  fit is great boost material is soft but responsive": "5", "I usually wear a 10 or 10.5 in Adidas. After trying the 10, I had to size up to a 11.

The price I paid was basically the same as some Jordan slides, but the comfort was a whole different story! I'm glad I ended up grabbing these Adilette Boost slides because I hoped that they'd be just as comfy as the Ultraboost shoes I love so much and they are! If you're a fan/lover of Ultraboost like myself, then grab a pair of these and you'll wear them all around the house and even out into the world like I do!

Loved them all but these are by far the most comfortable they have come up with yet. I have 2 pair of these ultraboost. 1 for inside and 1 for outside. However keep in mind the white one's will get dirty instantly, they are white. But obviously it doesn't affect how good they feel on your feet. Can't and won't wear any thing other than ultraboost! Once you try them you will be hooked too...": "5", "I have a bunch of Adidas slides. These looked cool, so I grabbed some. They do, in fact, look cool. But while I comfortably wear an 11 in every other Adidas slide, these are too narrow. I can squeeze them on, but they don't fit well. Also, the white footbed seems to collect an unreasonable amount of dirt. I mean, I get that it'll happen somewhat. And the surface is soft...like a suede. But you'd hope they'd use a less apt to take on dirt...especially on a white slide.": "3", "These flops are awesome & they're definitely a hit with anyone that sees them!": "5", "Buy it if you want comfort.

Help with the back too.": "5", "So I love these Ultraboost Slides the previous all black ones I bought in my actual size 9 fit perfect. I usually buy UB's shoes 1/2 size up.No need to with slides... or so I thought but this pair ran small compared to pair I was replacing from last years first release.They are very comfortable when sized right. These are just a bit narrow and held next to previous in same size one can clearly see a good 1/2 size difference. And I went originally with all white but those where TOO BIG in same size 9 and sent back for these black with white stripes.Best looking slides out there IMO.": "4", "The slides fit true to size and with that boost added materials, it just makes it a perfect fit all around. Comfort and style.": "5", "The best shoe to lounge around in! Better than any other slide in the market!": "4", "I've been wanting these for a while! I love my boost slide!": "5", "I'd recommend going a size up. I'm a size 8.5-9, and I ordered a 10 in these. The 9's are too snug on top.Not only is the boost one of the best comfortable midsoles, they lined the soles with felt. The tops of the sandal part is also cushioned for comfort.": "5", "A little snug and narrow but the boost is great! So comfy and the leather and rubber strap is cool.": "4", "Super comfortable just wish they were a lil more snug": "5", "These slides are great.

Super comfortable.": "5", "Nice quality good comfort I'll recommend it best sandal": "5", "Boost is what makes the slide and makes it much easier to use more frequently": "5", "Bringing the \"Boost\" material from the popular Ultraboosts to these slides make these slides extremely comfortable. They are some of the best I've worn. Does not seem quite the same as the boost in the shoes, but still a good experience. Only thing I found to be a bit annoying was that the slide loop over the top of the foot is a bit tighter/narrower than other slides that I have worn in the past. I would go up half a size if you are on the fence between sizes or have wider feet, even though length is spot on as the loop is not very stretchy.": "5", "I love the cloud foam Adilette but these Boost Adilettes are the best! Comfort through the roof.": "5", "Super comfortable and stylish. Got them for my wife and she absolutely loves them": "5", "Full foot comfort, from a hard day in heals to transforming into a soothing foot relief.  Love the feeling on my feet as it easily slides on without any difficulties.  Would be nice if there were a wide variety of colors to pick from but I'll take these without complaint.": "5", "These slides are great. Very comfortable, you will not regret the purchase. The width are slightly narrow. They do run small. If you wear with socks I would suggest 1 size up, but no sock half size up unless you wear thin socks. I wish they came in other colors.": "5", "These are nice slides but honestly I prefer my adilette comfort slides over these. Boost is super comfortable in tennis shoes but in slides feels more hard/stiff. Regardless they are nice.": "4", "This boost slides is perfect, comfortable and very nice on your feet.": "5", "Comfortable and lightweight. Will gladly buy another pair in all black. Only grabbed the white because it was the only ones in stock at time of ordering.

Top notch comfort and style!": "5", "I love that the stripes are black and not white the are soft do not hurt my feet": "5", "I love Adidas slides and I think it was brilliant to implement the boost soles!! Its like walking on pillows! So comfortable! 100% happy with this purchase.": "5", "very firm feel, still comfortable. true to size, can be narrow if you have narrow feet.": "4", "It has the exact same comfort of an Ultraboost shoe. Fit is perfect, very comfortable very happy with my purchase!": "5", "Go a size bigger because they run tight.  I will be exchanging them for a bigger size.  I wish they felt more bouncier though.  Hopefully the bigger size feels better.": "2", "I own a lot of boost running shoes so I had to get the slides. I love everything about them. The style, the boost, the different variations of the black and white combo. Thank you Adidas for always making top tier athletic shoes and clothing.": "5", "Super comfortable and great fit. Bought for wife and she loved them!": "5", "Very nice and very comfortable. Best slides ever. My new house slippers.": "5", "1 pair isn't enough. I have the solid black and the white ones.": "5", "These slides feel just like wearing my Yeezys, I love them": "5", "I use these as house shoes; the ultimate comfort.

But im only using them for quick on the go slip ons and house shoes so they work for me.": "5", "Same great feel as you would expect in a boost shoe": "5", "These are most comfortable slides I hav ever wore. Love the look.": "5", "Excellent purchase  very comfortable and looks very good": "5", "First off, love that this slide comes in all black. It is super comfy and cushiony. The only thing is that the sizing is inconsistent. We bought the same size in black and white and it is slightly larger than the black pair. Other than that, we love everything about it!": "4", "Very comfortable, nice cushion, fit perfectly, good width": "5", "would buy again. Boost makes it really easy to walk around": "5", "being able to enjoy Boost on slides is great for my everyday home use. these are very comfy. I also bought these for my nephew as an xmas gift.": "5", "Pretty cool to pretty much be able to buy an Ultraboost midsole and put a strap on it.

Otherwise, great purchase.": "4", "Very comfortable, perfect for the summer and winter": "5", "Beautiful ultra boost slides, something we've all wanted for five years.

Definitely recommend": "5", "Perfect for after sports or just chillin, with or without socks": "5", "Love the slides!

They're comfortable enough I guess": "3", "Adidas i want more variety of colors of this Boost Slides": "5", "The Best , Most Comfortable Slides I Own. Hands Down": "5", "I like these but they are a bit tighter on the sides than my other Adidas slides. They are very sturdy though. I do like the clean black look.": "5", "My only complaint is the opening near the toes is a bit shallow and takes some time to break in. My toes have felt a little tight, however the slide is overall a great product. I am a huge fan of anything boost related.": "4", "Honestly, these slides fit so well, I wear them all the time.": "5", "Love the slides! especially with the boost technology makes it very comfortable.": "5", "This is my second pair and I love them.

The white is great for summer.": "5", "The quality and comfort of the this item is amazing.": "5", "I purchased these for my son and they were small on him. I purchased a 7/8 because I read some other reviews that said the slides were true to size. They are not!  Overall slides are perfect. They are extremely comfortable but size up when purchasing.  It's a win for me because he gave them to me and I must say they feel perfect on me. I wear a 71/2 and these fit me just right.": "5", "I love how comfortable they are. They fit a little tight. Go up a size if you don't want to break them in": "5", "Comfortable fit and the boost is just right. I recommend getting 1/2 down for the perfect fit.": "5", "Most comfortable slides i've ever owned, this will be my 2nd pair.": "5", "Narrow fit and a little less bounce than the typical boost technology. Would recommend the cloud foams as they are more comfortable.": "3", "Very nice slides and quality. A tiny bit uncomfortable to spend the day in. Better to lounge around in": "5", "This slide has been exactly what I hoped for. Comfort of boost with a stylish and casual look. Small break in period and now aging with more comfort each day. The upper feels premium too. Boost all day, literally. Can now wear more boost between all my boost sneakers.": "5", "Adidas has the best looking slides. The original Adilette was an awesome slide, but it seems it got changed in modern times to a harder and very unforgiving material, that eventually will ruin my feet. The cloudfoam was an awesome answer to the overly hard ogs, and now finally boost corrects the issue cloudfoam presented. Cloudfoams feel great but have a sort of saggy cushioning that is perhaps too soft but feels excellent worn occasionally. Boost, and i have only had them a week, are about in between in firmness/softness and have the magic of boosts energy return. Essentially you feel better overall wearing these while walking around and standing because the responsiveness is perfect. I think they should replace the original Adilette with a boost sole, or just make these in styles that have the same look of the original adilette. Thanks Adidas!": "5", "good products good quality great comforter and stylish": "5", "You definitely need to try these particular slides... You will be amazed.": "5", "Stupid comfortable.  Extra light.  Nice fit, just a little tight across the bridge until you break them in.": "4", "Super nice and comfy. Well worth the investment. I wear them all the time.": "5", "This pair of slides is definitely one of the more comfortable  one I've had, but there are many shortcomings.": "2", ". It takes forever to dry. The neoprene material on the strap will take almost an entire day to dry by itself, your feet will be soggy unless you dry it manually with a hair dryer or something": "5", ". The sole is lined with this felt material that also takes a while to dry. It also traps foot odor": "5", ". If the strap absorbs even a little bit of water, it will swell up and rub the top of your feet. I sometimes even get a rash from it.I don't  understand why a pair of slides is designed to stay consistently moist. For comparison purposes, my Birks Arizona EVA dries within minutes of getting wet. Please refine the material used on this pair of slides! For the price we're paying, we should be expecting a lot more.": "5", "They're great, feel great, are absolutely comfortable. Don't have a single complaint about them.": "5", "Perfect fit. I love the gloves and they are super comfortable.": "5", "These are by far the best sandals I Have ever had it is like walking on Baby ducks!!": "5", "These are the best slides I've ever owned!

AndThese shoes are a bit loose": "5", "As a ultra boost fan I have been looking forward to boost slides for a few years now. Love the cushioning and the boost is as expected absolutely perfect feels like you're walking on a cloud. My only complaint is that the slides are not adjustable. They seem a little narrow in the top of the foot area but there is no Velcro to adjust the size width": "5", "These sandals are amazing. I purchased them for my wife and they fit perfectly. The boost sole makes them the most comfy sandals ever, and the adilette design is one every shoe company is still copying, which shows you just how slick looking they are. I'd highly recommend these.": "5", "I actually sized down, and that worked. I feel like if I bought my correct size that they would've been too big. They are very, very comfortable!

Wear a pair indoors, and another for outdoors": "5", "Best slide ever, Comfortable and worth every penny!": "5", "Most comfortable slides, bar none.  I have had several different name brand slides but these are simply the most comfortable.  I can be in them all day without pain thanks to the boost technology in the sole.": "5", "these are very comfortable and have been extremely durable since i started wearing them since i am the kind of person to wear slides everywhere i go.  The strap feels tight on the first wear but after an hour of walking in them they adjusted to my feet": "5", "Great slides they are super comfortable and great for post workout": "4", "I use these everyday. They are highly comfortable. This item is a must have.": "5", "It is pretty good slider.  However, it runs small.  I wear size 10 shoes regardless of the brand so i ordered size 10 and i felt that i was wearing size 9 or smaller when i put these on.  I would recommend you to order plus 1 size if you are going to buy this slider.": "5", "These slides pretty much go wear I go throughout the day. I find myself slipping them on while at work.

The quality is great and they're so comfortable.": "5", "Love these. I'm a size 6 in flat shoes/sneakers and they fit squarely in the black part of the foot bed.

Have purchased this show in two colors.": "5", "True to size. So comfortable, its like walking on clouds": "5", "Very squishy and since the whole shoe is a stretchy knit material with not much structure, sometimes I feel like my feet are swishing around inside an aquarium. One time while playing badminton, my whole foot slipped out of the shoe because it was so loose and I had purchased it in my usual size.": "4", "This review is for the black NMD with pink stripes that is 50% off. (Core Black / Signal Pink / Cloud White)Compared to the other NMDs I have in the same size (10), this one was just a bit snug before being broken in, and it could use a tiny bit more toe room, as the material is not very flexible, especially with the additional overlays.  Knowing this ahead of time, I might have ordered a 10.5 for this shoe if it had been available. My feet are wide, but UB DNA, UB 20, and the other NMDs I have that are made of more flexible materials all fit fine at size 10.  This pair is very comfortable now that I have worn them every day for a couple weeks, but they still could use just a bit more room in the toe box.": "4", "These shoes fit perfect and the shiny white is hard to keep clean but so fresh": "5", "So I got these sneakers this past Sunday and decided to finally wear them today, got tons of compliments. These sneakers are so vibrant and the pictures don't justify them, you need to purchase these. I usually wear an 8.5 but can get away with a 9, they don't feel too big. The only thing that disappoints me was as soon as I put on my shoes, the loop on the right sneakers came apart! I was so disappointed. I want to return them but who knows how long that would take.

I know the shoe is ment to be lightweight and minimalistic; however, the inside of the sneaker feels like they forgot to put a linner. The heel has small holes and starts to bother you after a short time. Unless you wear very thick socks, it is very uncomfortable.

This is the first of these shoes I've purchased so I was surprised that there was no sole liner. Just weird. However I still couldn't wait to put them on.

Previous prime-knit NMD's I've had have been very comfortable, but a bit loose feeling laterally, creating more of a casual, slipper-like feel.  These are significantly more supportive of lateral movement and I wouldn't hesitate to wear these for a night out on the dancefloor or mild out-door activities).  Very happy with them.": "5", "Shoes look amazing, but they just run too narrow for me, I wear them for going out, but not long walking or every day use.

What I love about these shoes is the 3-tone heel. The insole has some texture providing comfort and grip for your foot. I went a half-size down so I feel they run a bit large.

He loves them the style the comfort and the material ! Easy to wash is just the icing on the cake !! Thank you adidas and FINISHLINE  !!! Fishline is the only place I buy my 4 teenage  boys and 1 teenage girl their shoes at ! I highly recommend \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50": "5", "My first pair of NMDs and now I understand why they have remained so popular. Ridiculously comfortable and you won't expect to see anyone rockin this very unique, eye catching colorway. I live in the desert, so I also wanted an everyday shoe with black soles that won't look dirty.I didn't realize that these did not have a detached tongue. The shoe is definitely made to slip on and off. It took me some time to tune tune the tightness of the laces, so that it was t too tight in one particular spot. The laces don't slide very easily through the eyelets, but I think that's because they're not intended to be laced on and off... more of a slip on and off shoe. Once I got the tightness right, I haven't had to adjust. Highly recommend these.": "4", "Comfortable and I like it so much. I been waiting for the right size before and now that I really have it. Totally worth waiting for a very long time.": "5", "These shoes pair nicely with any outfit that I wear\u2026 Very comfortable for any physical, Sportime, strenuous activity.

However I would not recommend it for athletic activity other than walking as for me, the traction isn't always the best and there very little ankle support. And the fit of the overall shoe is looser than what you would need for a good running shoe": "5", "It looks like a good pair of sneakers to have a good walk": "5", "The shoes are good but go a full size up if you have a wider foot.": "4", "Everyone always ask where I got them from... I definitely  get all my shoes from finish line!!!! The best selection!!": "5", "Would definitely recommend for yourself or as a gift!": "4", "Bought these for my boyfriend. He loves them.

I have them in the Endor Leia, the Rey, and the Child version because they are my favorite work shoe. They do run a little big for a narrow foot, so if that's you, order a size down from your normal. I usually wear an 8.5 in everything, and I needed an 8 for a comfortable fit. Been wearing them at least 3 times a week since release, and they are showing minimal signs of wear, so definitely a great quality!": "5", "The shoe is light, breathable. Good exercise shoe.": "4", "Perfect fit love the color and shape. I would recommend this product.": "5", "These are new and quickly became my favorite of my collection. Very comfortable and really stand out if you like to show off your kicks!": "5", "I always have found that some NMD styles run insanely huge, like whole size down status - These are just one of those pairs!

Every hour that passed I just kept thinking about how my feet don't hurt YET. After a 8 hour shift, I still felt comfortable. The design is beautiful as well. I got a 8.5 but I could have went with my regular size of 8. My feet are on the wider side too. I just can't believe how comfortable they were lol.": "5", "Got this for my brother .... he loved it..... fits well": "5", "Super light weight and comfortable.

Awesome shoe otherwise.": "5", "Hmmm these really did not meet my expectations. They are much lighter and spongier than I imagined (and almost a size too big) but most prominently, the color of the sole is more like dark brown/ black, not the sort of light gum color that is advertised. Apart from that they were fine but I think my expectations were maybe too high. Felt a bit led astray by the sole color.": "3", "Slight bump in the center of shoe, makes it a little uncomfortable at first": "4", "My new go-to sneaker for running errands. Getting loads of compliments and very comfy.": "5", "I Been looking for these sneakers for a will now and was lucky to find my size. I love them so much I think I might get the white.": "5", "I really like the fabric and colorway of this shoe as it matches many of the brown tones I have in my wardrobe.": "5", "I'm a woman who has rocked the Samba for years, so I had to jump on these. Initially I got the darker pair (I thought the lighter pair looked kinda goofy LOL), but had to come back for the light ones too. Pure perfection!": "5", "This review is for the wool Samba Fox shoes.  First, I LOVE Sambas. They embody my soccer heritage and now as an old lady give me good feels about my athletic history while keeping my feet well styled whenever I wear them about town.  The wool take is excellent, making the shoes unique and evocative of vintage suiting.  The shoes are wearable out of the box, no wear-in required.  I love wool because it works when it's either warm of cold outside.  Samba's are not known for their sole cushioning, but if you need extra support or comfort, the shoe is roomy enough for an insert.  They fit true to size and not too narrow for my slight wide foot.  I love these shoes.": "5", "Another dope shoe to add to my collection. I like the orange laces to add some flavor.": "5", "Would highly recommend this shoe. It's a nice looking classic shoe that can dressed up easily": "5", "I have owned many pairs of Sambas. Classic looks, comfortable, goes with everything. Sometimes collabs can get a little crazy for my taste, but this Fox Mills mashup means that the material is lighter than the usual leather, the colors are special, and the overall look and texture makes people see something familiar, but as they look closer, they see more. These also come with orange laces, which they don't tell you, but made me so happy. If Adidas keeps this up, I'm in big trouble.": "5", "I've had sambas since the days of the large tongues and the trefoil.   I miss those": "5", "Fit's true to size, very comfortable, very light. Would recommend.": "5", "This is a good looking comfortable shoe. It feels great on my feet.": "5", "Loved the overall quality and detail that went into the shoe. Truly bringing back the variations that Sambas used to have": "5", "Always fit great and can't beat the classic style.": "5", "Got these shoes for my teenage son, and couldn't be happier. He loves them so much.": "5", "Old school style with unique color. In sole  has a warm fur that makes for a softer feel.": "5", "Ajuste perfecto, visten con mi mejor outfit, son mis preferidas.": "5", "These are awsome. A new twist to the old classic. I've been buying sambas for over 30 years. These are my  first non original style. I am very pleased. I love them.": "5", "These are classic shoes with additional flavor.  Added bonus of orange shoelaces to set off the orange heel tab.  These slip right on and fit well.  It rides like an OG Samba.": "5", "Great take on a classic shoe! Great color and design def a go to!!": "5", "Great looking and feeling shoes, but a tad too small. But not so small that I can't wear them.": "4", "I was worried at first that they wouldn't fit correctly because they were running rather small,plus I AM A Woman and these are technically men shoes but when I tried them on I was pleasantly surprised not only are they the dopest shoes ever,but they have a sorta Classic Feel that I totally love,and so I totally can't wait to take them out on the town": "5", "Nice s\u00faper c\u00f3modo , recomendados para todo tipo de hombre": "4", "These have been my favorite since high school. You keep making them, and I'll keep buying them!": "5", "Takes a awhile to where in the tongue. But you can also trim it to fit": "4", "I actually like the different color tones of brown! Good shoe to wear with shorts or a pair of jeans. Fast shipping!": "5", "These are a nice addition to a wardrobe. Love the sambas and these are a nice spin to them.": "5", "I've Always Had A Soft Spot For The Sambas, Not Just Cause I Play F\u00fatbol But They Literally Go With Whatever Outfit I Wear. Can Never Go Wrong With A Classic.": "5", "Great looking shoe, quality is spot on  would highly recommend  it.": "5", "Great classic shoe, similar to those worn by Freddie Mercury. Love the shoe. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the tongue is exceptionally long, pants covers it, but not sure about the look with shorts.": "4", "They are comfortable and look amazing just like any Samba you have ever had. They also come with orange laces as well, and they look awesome on.": "5", "I haven't worn them yet, but I plan on it soon. I really like the colors, and the material. I think I'll wear these with a brown shirt maybe, and brown pants. I have a Brighton jersey that sort of looks brown, and would go well with it.": "4", "I love these shoes.  I've been wearing basic Sambas for like 20 yrs. These are a cool variation and are every bit as comfy as the originals.": "5", "Definitely recommend. Colorway and materials are topnotch. Own over 25 pair of Adidas and these are in my top 5.": "5", "I love the wool. Super attractive look. Lives up to the photos- worth every penny.": "5", "I am blown away by the collaboration shoe. Really clean, stylish shoe. Love the wool on the shoe.": "5", "Definitely a staple in my wardrobe with a comfortable and stylish flavor!": "5", "The samba has seen many variations over the years, but the fox edition has really elevated it. The very cool unique wool covering and color combination makes this a real looker. Great quality.": "5", "10/10 really comfortable, you used all day walk, so im recommended": "5", "I bought both new classics. Nice material and different from the leather top. Great and fashionable classic.": "5", "These kicks pair perfectly with my new tracksuits.  Sambas have always been among my favorite Adidas, but the materials really make these something special.My only complaint is the tongue seems to require more breaking in than usual.": "4", "Classed up materials make this Samba a must have.  Same comfort and quality construction of any Adidas product. Exclusive materials incorporated well with the Fox logo inside and outstanding orange detailing. Top notch": "5", "These shoes really get me noticed.  You have got to get some!!!": "5", "The Samba shoe is an instant classic, with never a need to reinvent or change drastically but this take with Fox gives it a stylish take that you didn't know you needed. Great fit and comfort!": "5", "Great for indoor frisbee, I'm 6'4\" and they allow me to cut and handle comfortably": "5", "perfect everything has great fitment and really is how it looks on the pics": "5", "First pair of sambas ever and best pair of shoes I've bought in a while": "5", "It is the perfect shoes for any casual outfit and equally good with sweat pants and track pants.

Stylish and comfortable on and off the field.": "5", "These shoes are a classic and they look great on foot! Great school shoes.": "5", "My boyfriend loved them. These shoes are a wardrobe staple for him now.": "5", "I love these shoes so much, debating to get the black ones as well. I like these shoes alot because they are comfortable.  I don't get to wear them often because my toddler has a bad habit of stepping on my feet and I don't want then to ruin. So I am patiently waiting to pull them out for more use.": "5", "These are literally my favorite shoes to wear. I tend to wear them everywhere, 'til they fall apart. They are so comfortable and versatile. You can where them to the store, on the court, or even in the park. They are perfect for walks with my puggies.": "5", "These shoes are legit. No matter how many different types/brand of shoe I wear my feet are the best when I'm wearing these. Quality product and worth the money.": "5", "Still the best shoe I have ever owned as far as quality and endurance this is my 5th pair I believe of the whites and the black. In the past I would have rated the shoe a 5 star but they have since changed the gum sole of the shoe from the original gum color to this blackish gum color. Adidas does not make this apparent and even shows the old color sole specifically on the site in all pictures except a single user submitted photo that is hard to spot. I do still enjoy the new color but it is definitely not as advertised.": "4", "Man these are the originals... I hadn't owned a pair probably since year 2000 but wanted to add a pair to my closet. The arch support is ridiculously high and actually was giving me pain in the middle of my foot. I have a medium arch and luckily have some 3d orthotics. I don't have to change the insoles from my shoes often but these were not even wearable without them.": "4", "one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever had the chance of buying": "5", "Buy again. Good shoes. Wear comfortable. It is easy to wear daily": "5", "The color bottom sole is a very dark brown.

I look forward to wearing a new pair.": "5", "Classic look is awesome. Love the soccer type look.": "5", "They look great and they feel great on your feet. A little narrow on the knuckles": "5", "The Shoe did not feel right, very stiff. The color was completely different. The sole was almost black, not brown.": "2", "The Samba will always be in style. I've lost count of how many pairs I've had over the years. The perfect casual shoe. Thanks for keeping it available!": "5", "Check it and let me know . Okay?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "5", "Great buy for a quick cop. Stylish and comfortable": "5", "What else needs to be said?  The classic kicks from a classic age. Timeless design. Understated. Cool like dat": "5", "Would definitely recommend for anyone that is looking for white sneaker": "5", "Good quality and the comfort is nice too the shoe is actually pretty stylish": "4", "The shoe is great - ADIDAS though has to work on its consistency in the \"size-department\". Shoe-sizes between different models vary too much and in general the shoes are designed most of the time a bit too long. Otherwise I love your brand.": "4", "I love my new samba adidas, are so cool. Thank you": "5", "Overall good quality shoe. Runs a little long and narrow but seems well made and fairly comfortable.": "4", "Quality, Comfort, Style... Very durable!

Arrived in a timely manner.": "3", "Pleased ...........................      ..........": "5", "It's been a while that I had a pair of sambas. I prefer the OG version of the shoe and think its quality is slightly better. The width is good (I have wide feet) and the size is slightly smaller than my other size 10 shoes. I think this is in general for all adidas shoes I own.": "5", "OG Classic... I love this shoe. Definitely a must have in a sneaker closet": "5", "Love these shoes. Perfect for being on your feet all day.": "5", "We have bought countless sambas in our family and we are raving fans of the shoe.  But this shoe is weird.  It is so squeaky and I thought it might quiet down a bit over time.  But it had been some time and it is loud as ever.  It is a great looking shoe but you don't wanna be eating from your shoe in this way.  It's annoying.  It's embarrassing and it's unwearable with the continued noise of the shoe.  Come on adidas...don't let this happen to one of your most iconic shoes ever.": "2", "the  sambas  ots  the most have it  im you closet,  !": "5", "I love Samba trainers, they are the best, most comfortable shoes ever. They're my go to shoes for comfort and style. In fact I own several pairs in different colors. I highly recommend these trainers.": "5", "really nice leather footwear at a very reasonable price": "5", "Great looking shoe. Old school.

Smart and chic and a great fit!": "5", "Very comfortable and good quality. The sole is perfect for rainy days, you feet don't get wet! Perfect, I would buy again.": "5", "Perfect fit, style, and quality. Wears nicely with jeans or Adidas sweats.": "5", "They look really good on my feet and they are also really comfortable. I'm glad I purchased them.": "5", "Everything is great about this shoe but the tongue is slightly too long.  I wear ankle socks and they irritate the front of my leg, just above the foot.  If I wear pants they generally don't bother me.": "3", "Shoes are very stylish and sleek. Can be made a little more wider, however, the shoe fits perfectly fine.": "5", "Been wearing sambas Since i was 10 years old only shoe I'll ever wear": "5", "Definitely goes with any type of style you're going for.": "5", "Probably not for those that are aiming for support or have high arches.

Been wearing them daily.": "5", "I've always worn Sambas since I was little for soccer and they're just the best": "5", "Great sneaker, this style can pull of two looks and that's great! If you looking for an extra level of comfort just swap the insoles for better comfort. After a couple of hours my foot started to hurt but my outfit was looking fire with this sneakers! I still love the silhouette and the color just wish the Insole could be a bit more comfy!": "5", "While it's a good quality shoe it is not very comfortable. I have other adidas shoes the same size and these are smaller than the rest, the toe area is too narrowed as well as the arch area and feels like half my foot is hanging off, the sole itself feels like stiff. Even the leather doesn't seem s as soft as other of their products. I would not recommend this product, especially at that price point. I wish you guys still made the samba millennium!": "2", "Love me some OG Sambas. So comfortable and stylish.": "5", "Classic Adidas must have. I will always have a pair. They go with any outfit and any occasion. Quality is great.": "5", "Perfect with any pair of black jeans, these are a great pair of daily drivers.": "5", "Love it , brings back memories of my childhood would always buy again": "5", "Love this model. I would like to see some new colors, maybe pastel/earthy tones": "5", "I loved this shoe in high school many years ago and love it still today.

I love the fit and feel of the shoe and use it for impromptu  pick up soccer games as well as for general use": "5", "These shoes are more comfortable after breaking them in.": "5", "Haven't unpacked them yet, but we are hoping for the best!": "5", "While the tongue may be weird there are plenty of vids on YouTube on how to tuck the tongue to make it look more normal!": "5", "fit perfectly and very comfy, my feet never hurt after wearing them": "5", "Great shoe. Very slick. I wish they would have left the big tongue.": "4", "A bit too big and narrow. Quality seems fine. Love the style.": "3", "Ahh yesss the classics, very nice and love the fit to them, a bit wide for my feet but still super comfortable and just feels nice walking in them. Playing indoor soccer with them also just feels so different and right definitely recommend": "4", "great quality, comfort, and awesome indoor soccer shoes": "5", "Can't wait to see more colors in the future . And planning on getting more": "5", "Purchased these for my boyfriend and he loves them.": "5", "Listen to the reviewers who said order 1/2 size up! Usually wear a 10, but I ordered 10 1/2 and they fit perfectly. A 10 would be too tight in the toe. These are so comfortable and look good with everything. I feel like I can wear them for hours walking around or whatever. Will definitely order another pair when these are worn out.": "5", "Bought for my boyfriend who loves the Samba design.  He's a bike mechanic and is on his feet (around messes) all day long.  These are comfortable and sleek.  Bonus on the reflective properties of the shoe.": "5", "I tried to exchange the size and was not able. Disappointing.": "1", "My very first pair of Adidas shoes when I was a kid were the Samba shoes.  I loved them then, and I really wanted a new pair now as an adult.  I still love these shoes.

Its a timeless classic I would never give up.": "5", "Sent back now waiting for the right size to become available": "1", "I am so in love with these shoes adidas never disappoints": "5", "Besides the good quality and price this shoe has a good arch support and not to narrow, they fit perfectly. I bought a pair for my 10year old as well he loves them. Forsure a must have to add to shoe collection.": "5", "The reviews that mention the squeakiness are correct but a little overdramatic. There is a pretty noticeable squeak but starts to go down over time and there are a lot of solutions online if you don't want to wait for the break-in. There also is a sort of strange arch support built-in but I found it added to the stability on the support.It's just a reasonably priced classic sneaker that will do the job you want for casual wear. I haven't used this version to play indoor soccer in a long time but there are probably better options on this website than this shoe.": "4", "These are a little more snug than samba originals, but they're great for an every day shoe!": "5", "I am an aging soccer freak, but will never let go of the white Samba OG look.

Quality and comfort are great for him, he wears them until they fall apart and that takes him time.": "5", "These shoes are amazing! My fiance has been wearing them for over 10 years to play indoor and loves them. These are those classic shoes that will never go out of style. This is his third time purchasing.": "5", "every thing is good, but the size, after my son get his right size, will be very good": "4", "Very comfortable and great for the winter.  The only thing I wasn't that thrilled about was the shipping and customer service.": "4", "I love LovE LOVE Sambas!!!!! Sleek, stylish, yu can dress up or down. Must-haves I'm every sneaker wardrobe.": "5", "Amazing quality ,great price and the texture was class": "5", "For those who have ever had a pair of Adidas Sambas they are the highest quality turf shoe.

Would buy again. huge fan of the brand and am always looking for new gear.": "4", "Once you get a Samba pair of shoes, you'll love them for your rest of your life.

It is def beat up from wearing it so often but it still as comfy. really recommends it.": "5", "They were a little bit too narrow, but it was just fine for her": "5", "The shoe continues well past my toes as if a half size top  big, then in the heel area it gapes. Not a good fit. You need a fat heel and a really long narrow foot to fit these shoes": "2", "Got these for my boyfriend. He says they are super comfortable plus they look fresh. Got the gray color they do with everything!": "5", "Purchased as a daily shoe. Has a simple skating style but I find the material thin (I have not experienced any tearing though) and the insoles uncomfortable after a whole day.": "4", "These are classic Adidas..

I personally love the style of the shoe. It feels great": "5", "I LOVE this shoe! It's the PERFECT light weight everyday shoe. Idea for running errands, at the ball park, etc. Must have shoe, hands down!!": "5", "The shoes look great! The style works for casual wear, but after a while of just walking around my feet did start to hurt. The ankles don't have great support since it's technically for skateboarding so the edges push against your ankle making it a little uncomfortable, but otherwise it's a nice pair of shoes.": "4", "The show goes well with any outfit. The sole is a bit thin. The front arch is more oval that rounded.": "4", "Great shoe.................................\u2026\u2026\u2026...........": "5", "Just as advertised, great shoes and great fit. Great buy, recommended.": "5", "Bought this pair for my son who needed a good skating shoe to replace a VAN pair after he had it for over a year before it fell apart. I referred him to ADIDAS for quality and he liked this pair for its reviews. The shoes came within a week; by end of August and 2 months later it was shot. I mean literally shot, whole in the sole rips around toes and side.

I have a super hard time finding a good pair of shoes because I have wide, flat feet. I couldn't find the original pair to get them again but found these.

Totally happy with this purchase!!": "5", "I ordered these Stan SmithX Disney yesterday and they arrived today! Talk about quick shipping! The quality is great and I love the Kermit detail.

I'm pretty amazed by the quality of the shoe the details of Kermit and the custom shoe box. Makes for fond memories of waking up to watch the Muppet Babies on Saturday morning in the 80s. The Stan Smiths actually fit better than the Super Stars and pretty comfortable. Plus first time buying shoes from recycled materials and I can say that Adidas did an excellent job. Might just have to get another pair because these probably will become a collectors shoe and I  plan on wearing the pair I have. Now Adidas just need to make a  Gonzo, Ms. Piggy and the rest of the Muppet gang for the Stan Smiths, Samoas, or Superstar": "5", "NO MORE FEET PAIN AT ALL EVER THESE ARE THE BEST shoes I've ever had I swear": "5", "These look AMAZING.

I LOVE stan smiths and have been wearing them for awhile, they are an iconic shoe that has the reputation it has for a reason. I LOVE how adidas is going green!!:) since I am a climate change and environmental activist!. However in the process of making the shoe by other means and not the original leather, it has ruined the shoe both with quality and how they fit! they no longer fit quite the same way as the originals do. Why would you touch something as great as Stans and try to do something else in how they are made? Its a shame since I love the new pair I got but they are not Stan smiths anymore. I'm very disappointed since they are my favorite shoes. I don't usually leave reviews but had to this time. I will continue to love Stans as best I can, and do fully support the company in using the recycled materials!:).

If you're on your feet all day then I highly recommend a pair or two": "5", "Great comfort and style. Very flexible for outdoor use and activities.": "5", "Very comfy and very nice looking sneaker............": "5", "This shoe runs large. Size down if you are purchasing. Definitely go with the reviews.": "2", "Very comfortable shoe. Wish the rear ankle support was softer, feels a bit scratchy. Also wish the tongue was a part of the shoe as a whole.": "4", "Highly recommend for workouts or workRunning or great for walks": "5", "The color ways are vibrant and easy to match with clothes for working out.": "5", "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I don't normally spend 100 or more on sneakers but these were worth the money. They are incredibly comfortable and while I'm normally a size 6.5 a size 6 fits perfect!.": "5", "I had really hoped that these shoes would be all that my Trail Ultraboost are. Unfortunately they are not.Don't get me wrong, these shoes look great, but just as another review mentioned, these shoes are loud. It has something to do with the design/print on the toe area of the shoe. There's a very audible \"snap\" noise with every step. Also,... They just aren't as comfortable as my other Ultraboost. Not sure what the difference is. Either way I'm bummed because they look great, but just not for me. I will keep searching.": "4", "One of my favorites. I am VERY picky about what i wear on my body especially shoes. These are super comfortable i love the springyness from the heel. Going to be buying in a lot of colors!!!": "5", "Great shoe for its price! Cannot go wrong! Unfortunately this color wave came with a different toe box texture from what I thought.. when walking would make a slap sound of tarp like a tent. I wanted to shoes so bad, I wanted to keep them, i like the color a lot! The style and specially how comfortable they were. But every step made a sound, it was the tip of the shoe. I may be too picky but I don't want to walk n have my steps be heard like I walking on a foam plastic Mat.. it was the only reason why I return.. I'll order another color wave, this color wave seems to be the only one with that toe box material... great shoe over all.": "4", "I am in awe of how good these sneakers look and that they are so comfortable and soft. I'm extremely  happy with this purchase and honestly will have to look into buying more if they are all this comfortable and fashionable.": "5", "Item too big for me. I will be returning this week": "4", "Great material and quality and very comfortable": "5", "I own multiple Adidas shoes; NMDr1, ultraboost  and now the ZX 2Ks . WOW! the sole support and comfort is incredible. It feels like you're walking on 2 air mattresses. I am blown away from their added bounce in my walk.  Just another reason to absolutely love Adidas.": "5", "These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn! Perfect fit, and they look great!": "5", "Life long adidas wearing person here and I have to be honest. This pair of sneakers has been the most uncomfortable sneaker I have ever worn by far. The materials hurt my feet and the sneakers are even loud when I walk. Very disappointed in these sneakers especially after paying that much money. I do not recommend these sneakers at all. I don't ever write negative reviews but I felt like I needed to be honest about these sneakers and let you know my experience.": "1", "Great pair of shoes, the fit was perfect and they are very comfortable.": "5", "I was unhappy because there was little damage on shoes ( little cut )": "2", "Ordered for my dad, and when the box arrived, was pleasantly surprised by the box design. Themed around the NASA Artemis program and was a great complementary to the shoe itself- which was also amazing. Incredible comfort and fire design.": "5", "Super comfortable, the colors amazing and great quality!": "5", "Great shoe you should get a pair stylish, and comfortable": "5", "I love the colors!!!

Honestly more comfortable than my ultraboosts!": "5", "The flashing orange and silver will definitely make a statement as you walk into the room. These boosts are bold colors, cool designs and fashionable comfort.": "5", "Great looking and comfortable shoes. Size just seems to runs but big.": "4", "This was a good find! I was looking  for a shoe that I could work out in that would be good for the summer as well": "5", "This is such a good looking! I run with it and then go straight home to clean them up so that I could wear them again to the mall. Love these": "5", "So these do run slightly big nothing too crazy but if you prefer a nice fit I would go half size smaller.": "5", "I absolutely love these shoes. I get compliments on them all the time. They're comfortable and allows me to stand in them for 9+ hours without my feet hurting at the end of the day. I will be purchasing more of this style in the future.": "5", "These shoes are very comfortable and provide the nice recoil of the boost sole. The fit is great and shoes are nice and wide. My only complaint is the lacing system, it causes a little pressure on the top of your foot near your leg. After wearing them a few times I don't really feel it anymore.": "4", "A little tight for wide feet but perfect design but comfortable other wise": "4", "Comfortable and boss- looking! A half size smaller would have been a perfect fit. But I like the style the best.. they are a really cool looking shoes..": "4", "It feels like you are walking on pillows! They are so light on the feet. Highly recommend!": "5", "I like these sneakers. I wear thick crew socks with sneakers, so these fit a little snug.. But if you wear thin or \"regular\" socks, they should fit perfectly. They are comfortable and stylish, overall.": "4", "Love the look and color combo! Agree with reviews, definitely size down, I'm an 8 in women's and I ordered a size 7. Perfect fit!": "5", "Definetly will buy more than one pair! Super stylish for everyday comfort.": "5", "Material is to noise when you walk bit disappointed": "3", "I love how it feels anf fit. I can wear it all day.": "5", "These were way too narrow, but somehow chunkier looking than they appeared in the pictures at the same time. Loved the brown black and white color scheme but that was about it. I returned them.": "3", "The fit is great, and the quality of the shoe is very sturdy. I didn't even need to add shoe inserts, the arch support was spot on.": "5", "Does not seem like the normal quality gear i get from adidas very poorly made with loose stitching and blotchy colors.": "1", "This is my first pair of Adidas in years. The design of the shoe is clean in the white color way. Stepping into the shoes I was immediately taken away by how comfortable they were. Feels like walking on clouds but the shoe hold my foot. I highly recommend.": "5", "They feel like you're walking on air. Super comfortable and as soon as I had them on I was getting compliments from everyone.": "5", "Maybe it's because they are men's shoes, but the shoes themselves just were kind of bulky. I'm gonna wear them still": "5", "I am usually a 7.5 but they were too big, order half size smaller and they fit great!": "5", "A shoe that's know to be awesome, doesn't disappoint. Love the comfort and feel. Makes you feel like you can do anything when on your feet!": "5", "...This is the most cushioned  sneaker ever. However stability is not great for the same reason.": "5", "Most Comfortable Boost Midsole by Far. Not even close. The cuts on the bottom allow the boost to expand like crazy.  I just wish they made the upper a little more stretchy. If you love super squishy boost, pick these up asap!": "5", "These are straight up incredible, and that is an informed opinion. My collection is about 100 pair strong, and these look great like the rest. But the cupped-boost under the heel, and the stretchy knit upper - much better than other more rigid proprietary knits - along w/ nicely padded ankles (nice surprise for a knit sock-like shoe, listen up NMD) really set these apart - and far ahead - for comfort. Really bouncy & zero fatigue; actually kinda fun (?) to wear. Beats air, beats ultra boost & nmd, gel, all that. These are very, very comfortable. It's like each foot is riding in it's own little Cadillac. I see these featuring heavy in my summer rotation. So nice I'm buying twice.They could stand to be about 20% cheaper, though, like any boost-equipped shoe, just sayin'": "5", "Super light weight and very breathable for feet. Could stay on my feet for a while with high endurance with these shoes. Also they fit well for flat feet.": "5", "Absolutely love these shoes. Super light and comfortable af! Grab a pair!": "5", "Incredible very comfortable Great colorOne of my favorite shoe sale or purchase in the store": "5", "Absolutely love these shoes. Super comfortable. Ultra boost who?": "5", "I love this shoes, love the color and it's very confortable": "5", "First pair were too big, exchanged them. The rubber piece on top of the shoe digs into the top of my big toe joint every time I step. I will go back to the ultraboost next time. This is a great shoe. Super comfortable other than this one issue. Quality is great!": "4", "Best shoe I've ever bought love adidas, looking to get more shoes soon that match this style": "5", "Super comfortable to walk on, feels like stepping on clouds each step. Highly recommend for long walks or standing for long periods of time.": "5", "BOOST technology redefined! Super responsive! Top tier comfortability! 3 stripes for life!": "5", "I got these and the 380 yeezys. Both are amazing  !!!!": "5", "Great shoes, eye catching style, super comfortable and can wear them all day.  Great shoe for those that do not like the sock type upper as this pair has a tongue where it will allow you to loosen the shoe if needed.": "5", "Overall good shoes and comfortable. The color way is dole and goes with a lot": "4", "The sneaker I bought is very comfortable it has good cushioning.

True to size. Fits a little tighter than the ultra boost 20s. The pink insole is sweet too. I can wear them for a long period a time but they aren't ultra boost 20s.": "4", "Nice but too big . Smaller size was needed for me myself and I.": "5", "I bought these for work, and they are very nice and great for work. Super breathable and light on the feet. Awesome arch support. Would recommend.": "5", "It's super comfortable, the colors are like the image, great quality.": "5", "If your looking for some shoes with a nice design and great feel, these are them!": "5", "Great shoe! I just wish it was true to size. Definitely go down half a size from what you regularly wear. Perfect to just lift at the gym or just to casually wear. They looked much better on than I thought they would!": "5", "Loved the design, the fit is very comfortable. I could wear them every day.": "5", "I like the color the way is made and is perfect for me": "5", "I would recommend these shoes to everyone! That's why I only wear Adidas because they never fail!": "5", "It has a great look to it matches everything I wear": "4", "Love the sneakers they are comfortable and the price is very right you will not be unhappy": "4", "True comfort with the instant classic boost technologyUnique style and versatility not to mention the color wayOverall satisfaction use them for the gym and work mostly": "5", "I'm a budget sneaker head and these look awesome and feel awesome!

Love that soft and squishy feeling.": "5", "Exactly what I was hoping for. Nice vibrant orange and blue accent colors. Fit perfectly": "5", "very soft and solid, good for daily walking and running! the only draw back is the fabric of this shoe has some air, sometimes it will get into some dust, but it does not matter too much. Overall, it's great shoe.": "5", "These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned": "5", "I am a waiter so I would like to know. Does it slippery?": "5", "Love the style and the color. Had to return because it runs a full size bigger. FYI size down": "4", "These look awesome. Fit wider then other brands which I need.  I have moderately wide feet and these fit nicely.  BUT the back part of the shoe fits weird.  When taking a step and the heel comes off the ground,  my heel slips and it becomes \"Baggy\" around my heel. This makes my step funny and thus my walk is off. I have tried to tighten the laces at the top,  but that just hurts that top part of my foot.  I do really like these and that's my only complaint.  Guess I'll deal with it.  I am unsure how these would work for a runner.": "3", "I originally did not want to purchase this color but I'm glad I did they are very comfy and the colors really pop out can't wait to wear them this spring": "5", "love these, a tad on the long size though.plan accordingly": "4", "This is a fashion shoe on the large side.

They are, by far, the most comfortable shoes I have ever warn. Not my first purchase and definitely not my last!": "5", "I got these for walking around leisurely.

Would definitely recommend!": "4", "Most comfortable running shoes ever": "5", "Love the look of the shoe but the width and length measurements are off. If you have wide feet, this shoe will not feel comfortable. It has given me blisters. The length isn't bad but seem longer than necessary (I am a size 12). Materials are not bad. Not as high quality as my Ultra Boost 20's or 4D's. I think the actual shoe is comfortable in terms of cushion, they just need to work on the actual materials above the sole.": "3", "I know this is an older release of a ZX 2K but ever since I purchased my first pair I've been hunting down and purchasing every colorway I can. This makes my 6th pair of ZX 2K's. These are the most comfortable sneakers I own - I believe they're more comfortable than the Ultraboost line. I won't mention other brands here but the ZX 2K are more comfortable than all their comfort lifestyle sneakers with multiple technologies. The best description I can give someone on why these are more comfortable than Ultraboost comes down to one simple word - \"squish\". These feel fantastic underfoot. This colorway along with some others has a detached tongue - some have an attached tongue where the entire upper becomes like a sock. I'm a fan of both and they both feel great. If you're looking for comfort sneakers and have not tried these - try them. You will not be disappointed. They fit true to size and all pairs have been breathable enough to not leave my feet feeling hot. I have not used these in a performance aspect such as running but for the casual wearer who just wants the most comfortable sneakers out there - look no further. Adidas also has excellent customer service and CSR's and any issues I've had they promptly fixed or exchanged and then some.": "5", "Excellent Shoes for daily use, extremely confirmable. Boost gives a lot of cushioning.": "5", "I bought these for my husband and they are definitely amazing!

My best friend loves it but it was too big on her. She regularly wears 8.5 but after an exchange even 8 was too big on her. Please keep that in mind.": "5", "These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  Along with the great color combination, the style and fit are very good and the shoes get lots of compliments. I'd definitely recommend these shoes and will be getting another pair.": "5", "These sneaks are comfortable and the colors are vibrant.

Should I have stopped a few shoes ago? The simple answer would be no, the complex answer would be what's one more pair.I saw these shoes a few times throughout the past year and thought to myself, \"if I do go for a pair it would be these.\" I needed a pair of white shoes but I didn't want to settle on something that I had previously. So I did the one thing I thought would help me and that was \"Save\", save them for a rainy day, save up for them, I clicked \"save\" and imagine what they would feel like once I had them in my possession.Here we are, you're reading this, and I am wearing these. I guess we both got what we wanted in the end.": "5", "Son wanted a pair because he liked the style.

They are very comfortable and super light. Worth the price.": "5", "All adidas shoes tend to run narrow, which is why I always go an extra half size up to accommodate for it. On these shoes however it wasn't quite enough, gotta return them. Other than that they are nice shoes, I liked the style and material, quality of construction was good. It's just a shame they didn't fit better.

I decided to take the chance & intended to order the 7.5 since the other two sizes were too big. Unfortunately human error got in the way & I ordered the 8 again.

They are good looking and the sole is great. I fear the tab in the back may be a bit high for no show socks (my sock of preference) but other than that, a great shoe.": "5", "I'm a huge Adidas fan - especially with Ultraboost which changed the sneaker game forever.  But this par was supposed to be the next best thing in comfort and I was not impressed. My two year old ultraboost were more comfortable. I didn't love the structured shoe finishes - they felt cheap and the 3D printed sole looked cool but that's kind of it.": "3", "Oh my gosh! These shoes have truly been shoes to me.": "4", "Show looks great. Get lots of compliments. However the shoe is not very comfortable. The sole is fairly hard and stuff. The tip of the show is also hard and stiff. Leaves top of your foot uncomfortable and sore.": "2", "For me it is a bit narrow so it is not comfortable for me": "4", "If you are the type that gets blisters on the back of your ankle from certain shoes I would not buy them. These shoes dig at the back of my heel and it hurts. They also have no support so aren't very comfortable at all. They are also pretty narrow from the front. The show itself is esthetically pleasing.

I walk over 10 miles a night while working...4D changed the the game for me :)": "5", "The look of this shoe is absolutely fantastic. The 4d sole is a real unique compliment to the lineup of shoes I wear on the regular. The shoe is also quite comfy. My single complaint with the shoe is the sizing runs a little large (next time I'll go a half size down) .": "4", "The silhouette is genius. It is a stylish shoe. Love it.": "5", "Flimsy. Just tightening laces and the loop broke. The show looked and fit great. Was looking forward to wearing them. What a pity.": "1", "I was originally shipped a defective pair where the eyelet loop was already broken so I could not lace them up properly.  I then had another pair shipped to me and after wearing them 3 times the eyelet broke.  I had to send them back for a full refund.  It seems they were not made very well.": "1", "As a huge fan of the boost and bounce cushioning systems I've wanted to try 4d.  Theses are comfortable and have just the right fir.": "5", "Bought as a Christmas gift for my son.  He loves the fit and says they are super comfortable": "5", "I will start by saying I love adidas it's is all I buy for me and my child NMDs are by far the most comfortable sneakers! I buy a ton of adidas stuff at least 10 pairs this year! With that being said these 4ds were a bad design the loops used for the shoe laces broke the first time I laced them up and I don't even lace my sneakers tight! And they are uncomfortable": "1", "the comfort and style is perfect, but in order to wear them with the laces as I'd like, they are a little loose. They won't fall off, but I definitely can't wear them as they were shipped. I need to tie them tighter. Overall, great look and feel!": "5", "Overall, I like these shoes.  Pros: look cool, pretty comfortable.  Cons: a little heavy for longer runs, weak lace loops (broke one on my first run) and more expensive than similar competitors.": "4", "Overall, I like the shoe.  Pros: look cool and pretty comfortable. Cons: a little heavy to run longer distances, the lace loops are weak (broke one on 1st run) and they're more expensive than similar competitors.": "4", "I absolutely fell in love with this shoe.  The cushion and support you receive from this shoe is very well balanced.  On my fourth run in this shoe, the top eye-loop for the shoestring broke.  I am so disappointed that a key style and function element failed.I am hoping to find a replacement, but I spent so much time researching this shoe.  No I have to start all over.  For the price of the shoe, I am very disappointed in the quality.": "2", "Very cool to look at and the comfort level on these does not dissapoint.": "4", "Bought them for my brother for Xmas.

I'll definitely do more business in the future.": "5", "They look awesome and have received a lot of compliments on them.": "5", "I have small feet and find depending on style of sneakers I purchase the size will vary for a perfect fit. Of the 8 pair adidas sneaks sizes 6, 6.5 & 7. I fine 6.5 being the perfect fit but the last 6.5 are cut big. I only wish sneaker size would be consistent with all styles": "5", "Feels better than the boost but easy to be dirty at the bottom": "5", "I work at a hospital and my colleagues call me the fly guy": "5", "The shoes have a great look while remaining extremely stylish": "5", "The top is too hard and inflexible. Very different from flyknit. I wish I had read the reviews as I'm also experiencing chafing. The top of the heel digs into the Achilles' tendon so much that I had to put bandaids. It made the skin raw even with high socks! Also, my pinky toes were getting crushed to the point of blistering on my first walk with these shoes. They might be ok if they stretch out enough with time, but it was a shock to experience this level of discomfort with running shoes, from adidas no less. The best part is the sole. Love that.": "3", "Beautiful shoe! Runs a bit too long.  A little heavier than I expected.": "3", "Shoe is looks good and the 4D sole is an eye catcher.  Adidas made the wrong decision with the eyelets.  My pair broke after a few light wears.  I untie my shoes each time I take them off and lace them loosely since they were a little bit wider than my foot.  This should not have been an issue.": "1", "I gave to my boss x-mas gift.He loves this shoes.": "5", "These are a really comfortable well made shoe, but mine ran a little small in length and width. Would highly recommend them.": "5", "I like the shoes but they are a little stiff at first, I was thinking all black but the Grey help accent the shoes, please change the shoes strings they take away from the shoes.": "4", "Shoes are very comfortable, just not as cushioned as Ultra Boost. Feel a little more responsive than Ultra Boost. Wa surprised that they are heavier than we thought they would be. Would still buy them again.": "4", "Look terrific, great fit, very comfortable. Highly recommend.": "5", "Honestly, the best pair of everyday sneakers I've ever purchased.": "5", "Nice and comfy... size bigger than expected but still fine": "4", "Most expensive pair of shoes I have purchased for my son.  Unfortunately on the VERY first day the shoe ripped and now it cannot be tied properly.": "1", "Runs a little a little bit and is heavier than I expected.

Great quality": "5", "Very comfy like walking on clouds.  Would purchase again.": "5", "Everyone says they are not the ultra boost. They are not the ultra boost, they're better IMO. Not as squishy as UB much more stable  feel to the sole. UB are very comfortable but these are a perfect mix between comfort and function. Will definitely move to 4D in the future": "5", "He loves them, the fit is perfect and comfortable. He's able to get the performance of a athletic shoe, and a stylish look of ZX plus a 4D lower.": "5", "it is different , that is for real , you have to get the feeling that this is a running shoe , plastic is good , but certainly is going to the future , I liked as a running shoe , not for a daily , but need more time using it": "5", "Just as advertised. Loved the colors on shoes. Great value, too!": "5", "Excellent product , very comfortable and stilish at a great price": "5", "Great and comfy sneakers , always wanted a person and they lives up to the hype !": "5", "Soooo comfortable. Really well built, and the fit is on point": "5", "Great show overall. Comfortable, fit correctly, look great. I'm not a big fan of the materials used for the upper, not as comfortable as I like, much prefer the knit upper and sock like feel of other ultra boost shoes. But it's still a great show.": "4", "great pair of shoes, fit as expected. Feels comfortable": "5", "The shoe is extremely uncomfortable in comparison to the ultraboost": "1", "The looks and the comfort are great. The bottom part of the shoes are the best part of the shoe.": "5", "Very comfortable and firm, i wear them to work and i work 10 hour shifts. My feet be feeling fine the whole time!": "5", "Always wear a 10.5, ordered a 10.5, sized more like an 11.  Everybody comments on the style of the shoe!": "5", "Bought for my 12 year old son for running and his weight training sessions. Very comfortable. One of the shoelace holes ripped after a few months otherwise fantastic shoe.": "4", "The perfect shoe for casual wear. Comfortable on the feet. Would recommend.": "5", "I'm a sneaker head and have over 80 pair of adidas. I was really excited when these came out. And now I realize the hype is real. These are super comfortable and my feet don't hurt by the end of the day.": "5", "The upper is a little stiff unlike the Ultra Boost Summer RDY, and the 4D sole feels a little harder than Alpha Edge 4D.I'll stick with Ultra Boost next time, specifically if Adidas comes out with UB 20 Uncaged...": "4", "I love the black 4d! Very comfortable and look great with my tiro pants!": "5", "Silver on shoe is not 3M but would of been a great addition.": "4", "These shoes are off the hook. They fit great are super comfortable and worth the every penny.I've purchased 3 pairs of 4D's and love them all. I highly recommend them.": "5", "Comfortable shoes. Fit great and look great. Great all around shoes for walking, jogging, working out, or just for style.": "5", "Doesn't worth the price, hard and uncomfortable. Too wide.": "2", "A little more stiff than Ultraboosts but the arch support is pretty good too.": "5", "I put inserts in my shoes so I get my regular size but if you don't go a Hal's size down": "5", "These shoes look as good in real life as they do in the pictures. I enjoyed running with them, until 20 minutes into my run when my ankle started to hurt. By the time I had finished my run, the shoe's back tab had rubbed through the skin on the back of my Achilles. If you wear long socks, this won't be a problem for you, but I always wear short. I bought athletic tape to wrap my ankle before runs from now on, but I really wish this wasn't an issue.": "3", "A very heavy shoe may not wear good for a long period of time": "4", "The design is good and the shoes are very comfortable. The color combination is perfect.": "5", "These are by far some of the most colorful shoes in my closet and they go with so many outfitz. They are a little larger than anticipated but they don't look clunky. Just simple with a bit of flare.": "5", "I really love the look of these shoes. I wanted to try the 4D range however they are uncomfortable. I thought after breaking them in it would be fine but it causes so much pain that I cannot walk in these! Overall, it's a nice product. Sadly, they just don't fit me well... I am gonna have to return them": "3", "I bought a pair and the orange loop for the laces broke. I returned them and exchanged them for a replacement. It happened again 1 week in. Poor quality /design.  DO DON'T GET THESE": "1", "I'm a long-time fan of adidas shoes (I have 4 pairs of various ultraboost styles), and I love these shoes, but there's clearly a serious design flaw in the lacing system. The small loop snapped the second time I wore them when I attempted to tie my shoe. For a sneaker at any price point, let alone THIS price point, this shouldn't happen.Customer service was effective and is sending a new pair. I see others have had this happen with the lacing loops as well, but hopefully this flaw is an inconsistency in production and not a problem across all the shoes.": "1", "Stiching across top of foot is uncomfortable.Would not recommend": "3", "Hands down the best shoe I have ever owned. I was skeptical about the 4D technology but this is going to make it hard to buy anything else. Kudos!!": "5", "Very comfortable with good cushioning and support.": "4", "The shoe is worth every penny. It's good for leisure or working out.": "5", "It's too big for my size 7.my feet got hurt.it became reddish after i wore it.": "3", "The one of the little orange loops that the shoe laces are laced through snapped on the first day. It is a very poor design. The loops should be made from a much more durable material. For as long as Adidas has been making athletic shoes, you would think they would know better than this by now.": "1", "Very comfortable. But too much room in toes and wide enough": "4", "Shoe seems to fit alittle tight, and was very uncomfortable.": "3", "I have been waiting to get a pair of 4D, and I finally got them.  Well worth the wait!  Love them!": "5", "They are light and comfortable. I'm a runner and I noticed these don't have as much cushion as the ultraboost. Still great shoe.": "5", "I cannot say enough about my new pair of ZX 2K 4D sneakers.  I have had many others saying that they really like the style.  Job well done\u2764\ufe0f": "5", "Really good looking shoes! Perfect for the value! If you're interested in a 4D adidas pair, this is a must have one!": "5", "Fantastic Fit. Technology mixed with art. More comfortable and responsive than an ultra boost.": "5", "Wanted to love this shoe, and felt that if I broke it in that I would fall in love with it (looks really cool). Unfortunately this shoe is extremely uncomfortable. The pain area is where the lace loops line up with the tongue of the shoe. For some reason they dig into the top of my foot. After walking around with them for a while the pain really does get annoying. Will most likely return these.": "2", "The shoe feels pretty stiff and there is way too much wiggle room in the toe area compared to the heel of the shoe. The 4k soles look really cool but feels really stiff to walk/run in. I prefer the Ultraboost technology compared to these.": "1", "Great product. The 4D sole is second to none. Greatly reduced my knee and sciatic pain.": "5", "I could not take it off It was so comfortable and it was AMAZING": "4", "2nd time I wore these very expensive shoes, the lace loop near my ankle broke leaving the shoes unwearable.  I returned them for a full refund. But printing a return label and going to the FedEx store was not what I have planned when I bought them.": "1", "The shoe has a lace eyelet that was ripped. I'm not sure how that was not identified during inspection.": "1", "Crisp and clean 4D. Big fan for the price, can't bear it.": "5", "One of my first Adidas purchases in years and 4D does not disappoint": "4", "Me encantan estos zapatos su dise\u00f1o y comfort los recomiendo 100%": "5", "I wanted to experience the 4D to see if its worth getting the Ultra 4D. Pros: Unique look, great design/markings, breathable ZX upper. Cons: 4D is heavy (compared to Boost), collects dirt/debris easily, not enough traction on outsole & is slippery on wet pavement": "4", "Working as a nurse I rely on comfortable shoes and these fit well and provided maximum comfort.": "5", "Great shoes the fit is perfect and they are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend.": "5", "the style is what I wanted, so I'm satisfied with my purchase.": "5", "they were worth the price. solid and nice fit on the feet.": "5", "Very comfortable, light, gives you the support standing all day, walking and jogging on it is just amazing.": "5", "This is a must to any collection.. from the overall creation to the comfortness": "5", "All around great shoe! I love the 4D technology. They do take a few wears for the sole to mold to your foot but not a big deal. The quality is great and the material is breathable.": "5", "The best quality for the amount of money. I wear the shoes for 12 hours where I am on my feet the full time.": "5", "Very comfortable for everyday use. Not a running shoe": "5", "The sole on the shoe makes you feel like you are waking on bean bags": "5", "Love the new 3D soles and reflective laces. Definitely a good cop.": "5", "I have a second pair of 4Ds coming. Can't wait for it to arrive": "5", "The upper rubber eyelet broke on the first  day that i use it.so disappointed.i wish i can still return or replace it with an ultraboost.": "3", "Nice fit, super comfortable and look great with shorts": "5", "I have abt 15 from the ultra boost line. These look cooler but they aren't as comfortable": "4", "First time, I repeat, first time tying my shoes and one lacing loop pops out of the shoe. I've read other reviews in which this has happened and I'm upset that this is the quality of shoe adidas would put out there.": "1", "I wore the shoes today at work and my feet are so sore right now. It's painful to walk with these shoes on. I don't recommend it to anyone. It lacks support and cushion. It's just lovely to look at but it's not comfortable at all.": "1", "I love these things! No regrets! My only qualm is the toe. Just slightly a bit bigger, and too much room. I'd suggest running 1/2 sizes smaller. I'm a solid 10 1/2. I think a 10 would have been better. Nevertheless, I love em! I get complimented on them almost every day. Winner winner chicken dinner Adidas!": "4", "Fit perfectly, but after walking in it for a day, the plastic on the top started to dig into my foot and started causing severe pain, even with shoelaces very loose.": "1", "The shoes are very comfortable! Everything is good! But there have a little problem that The front corner of your shoe pinches your big toe when you walk.": "5", "I've had these shoes about a week now, worn around the house to break them in. The rear end of the shoes dig into my heels, the sides poke at my ankles. Very stiff, assuming that may pass with time. I thought based on the looks of the shoe that the 4D tech sole would be squishy, it's hard as a rock and offers little support. The shoe looks great, but is uncomfortable. A generous 3 stars.": "3", "These shoes are so comfortable! I like the shoe sole design, it's really cool! I bought this for my brother and my mum,they really like it! So I recommend the 4D shoes!": "5", "The left eyelet string broke on the 3rd time lacing them up. Very dissatisfied.": "1", "I've had been wanting to get a pair of 4D's for several months but they would always sell out of my size. Lucky for me I was able to get a pair a week ago and I'm very satisfied. I have received several compliments on the styling. Fit and comfort are King.": "5", "Two of the pink loops broke in first week. These shows look cool but are cheaply made.": "1", "They look great. The tongue is stiff so the first couple wears hurt the top of my foot but decent shoes after broken in. Good for athleisure and an upper body/mild lower body gym day. The issue is the eyelets snapped on me after about 10 wears. Can't use them anymore...": "2", "The quality definitely validated the purchase. The 4D is exciting to try out and makes for great conversation starter with others. Comfort makes for an excellent all day sneaker.": "5", "Love these shoes. It's definitely the eye-catch shoes.": "5", "This is my first pair of 4D and I'm impressed. Very good looking shoe and quite comfortable.": "5", "I got these for a very good price, and I'm glad I did.  They are very comfortable and stylish.  The 4D tech is awesome.": "5", "Great color and extremely comfortable. Shoes can be used for training or walking": "5", "Good to workout in do calisthenics, looks good, a lot people like them": "5", "These shoes are top tier they look nice and feel nice": "5", "Comfy but a little heavy , the materials are solid however due to the 3D printed material it weighs a bit , not as comfortable as ultraboosts.": "4", "Great I love the feel very comfortable easy to order totally awesome": "5", "Great overall look and feel. Would purchase another pair in the future.": "5", "I was so excited to wear the shoes the laces a broken": "4", "I love these sneakers. I purchased my regular size 6 in men's. It's a comfortable sneaker and soft, I purchased two pair. The upper material doesn't stretch easily, I'm guessing this is why some comments mentioned that the sneaker is tight or tough. It's supposed to be this way. If you have wide feet or fat feet size up.If you have narrow slender feet, purchase your true size.": "4", "Slightly firmer ride than ultra boost but still very comfortable": "5", "Plastic around the toe area is very uncomfortable.": "2", "Though not as springy as boost, the 4D sole still not a bad option. This pair is sleek. Who can go wrong with an (almost) all black pair? Satisfied with the purchase.": "5", "Look great. Getting compliments  and wearing with pride.": "5", "Everyone should buy it, this is the best color you should buy": "5", "Can be used as everyday shoe with support or run/walk shoe.": "5", "I love Adidas and I'm always a women's size 7. Since these only come in men's sizes I ordered the recommended men's size 6 (women's 7). But it was much to big. I exchanged for a 5m/6w (the half size was unavailable) and the were a tiny bit too small.": "3", "I would recommend this sneaker to friends and family": "5", "Shoe all in all is not bad not as comfy as the boost but . Easy to keep on the feet.": "4", "I love this style and color way I want another pair": "5", "There are some minor glue stains, 4D has some excess material stuck in little crevasses, and the toe box area is too low.": "4", "I got these and only wore them once. The cord that's being used as eyelets for the laces came undone on the left sneaker.": "1", "Super comfortable and very cutting edge with the trends.": "5", "Amazing fit will hopefully get more pairs soon. Wonderful": "4", "This shoe was a terrible purchase. It provides no cushioning, was too big for my size, too wide, and on top that the \"dental floss\" shoe laces loops that come on the shoe broke while attempting to tie them rendering this shoe completely useless. If I could I would definitely ask for my money back. This shoe was a waste time and the \"4D\" technology was not impressive what so ever. DO NOT BUY!": "1", "If you want more cushion go with solar or ultra boost.": "4", "Great style and everything but the crease hurts when I walk, the material is too hard. I also have the reflective one and that one is perfect": "4", "Have been using the shoe everyday since I purchased. It's extremely comfortable and easy to wear.": "5", "N/A - nothing else more to say.  But aVery comfortable shoe": "5", "Nicely made shoes that are great for everyday use. I use them for walking, jogging and light running. When it's time to step it up I switch to my zx4000 4d run shoes.": "5", "Totally worth it! Super comfortable, and great for all day wear": "5", "The greatest thing about the shoe is how squishy they are. Clouds on feet for real! One thing is that since my foot is fat, the toe box is super soft and my toes poke up and stretch it but only someone who looked at your shoes all day would notice. Otherwise, you can really feel the softness.": "5", "Very comfortable shoes.  Nice design.  Fit comfortably.": "4", "I expected better for the price. I wear a 7 1/2 and I had to resize for a 7 and they're still a tiny bit roomy at the toe. They are well made other than that. The soles are bouncy when you walk and feel comfortable. I wouldn't buy again for the price.": "3", "I was so excited to get these looking just at the pictures...but I wasn't happy how it looked on me just a preference...Overall it had a unique style and the pictures made the shoe look great just not on me...It had great cushion since I work on my feet most days and it's very comfortableMaterial was different i am used to the breathable cloth...but overall great for comfort n  easy on your feet": "4", "This is a incredible shoe and extremely comfortable": "5", "First, the design of this shoe is amazing. It was the first thing I noticed. This makes cardio a breeze. Lightweight, good quality, and comfortable in multiple situations. What more could you want?!": "5", "The tounge is not attached to the upper, which causes it to slide all over the place and the upper is durable but does not flex well when your foot is flexing in the shoe. For me it was actually uncomfortable on the top of my foot and toes.": "3", "I absolutely love wearing these for fashion as well as working out.  The bright rich colors attract many compliments.": "5", "Most comfortable shoe I've purchased with adidas this year.": "5", "Super comfy and stylish!

Very comfortable for walking and easy to clean": "5", "I love them. Best shoes I've ever purchased besides my soccer shoes.": "5", "Adiadas never fails. The shoes are so comfortable and true to size!!!!!!!!": "5", "They are awesome and very good  its like walking in a cloud": "5", "the level of comfort these shoes bring while working out and/or doing everyday activities is insane ! Adidas has really stepped their game up with the overall comfort and style their shoes have. I definitely recommend if you have trouble finding shoes for your flat feet and/or if you find it difficult to find shoes that do not accommodate your wide feet.": "5", "Love the look of this shoe and it is very comfortable.   Unfortunately it is way too big for me!  I'm not sure if I would go a half or whole size down.  They don't have the half size in stock right now.": "5", "Just a little lose in heel area even when sizing down half a size.": "4", "I used everyday": "5", "They feel very comfortable. It honestly didn't hurt my heels when I walk a lot": "5", "Good shoes. Lasted 6 months which is good for them being work shoes.": "4", "These shoes were extremely comfortable straight out of the box.  The fit slightly tight in the width which I don't mind.  Overall I would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone who wants a lightweight and comfortable shoe.  I'm not sure on the durability yet since I haven't worn them much but have a vacation coming up with a lot of walking so we shall find out.": "5", "Airy and light shoe. Support is great for a light lite weight shoe. The last pair I had lasted along time.": "5", "Nice and Comfortable shoes good price really love them and like the color too": "5", "Feels comfortable, shock absorbing..excelle t quality.": "5", "I like the fit of shoes": "5", "Great quality and comfort.

The shoe just looks a little longer than my feet really are, I don't have that problem with other sneakers from adidas": "5", "Owned and wear several adidas shoes over the years. All mine are size 11. Bought these in 11, they seemed more like 12s. Fit was terrible and uncomfortable to wear.": "3", "Bought it for someone and they loved it so much.

Wear them as much as I can.": "5", "Just don't understand why more shoes would be available in wide sizes.All everyone seems to care about is wild colors and not quality.

Love Adidas": "5", "Good shoes for everyday wearing around the house and the are stylish as well": "4", "I've never owned a pair of Adidas shoes before. I'm not a sneaker head by any means or very interested in wearing recognizable brand shoes. That said, I actually bought these shoes for the sole purpose of running as I'm training to run a 10k and then eventually a half marathon. As I've been getting into running, I realized that I needed better running shoes than my Walmart pair, no shade there, but I needed something good. I figured I'd buy nice instead of buying twice and I'm glad I did. So far, I've really enjoyed how light and comfortable these shoes are. I didn't realize just how important having good running shoes were until I got these. These shoes are definitely a good buy for any beginning runner like me.": "5", "They are a very comfortable pair of shoes, however, they are not very breathable.": "4", "Very comfortable, very nice and easy to combine is just fine in every description": "5", "I only purchase adidas shoes only because I love adidas and it is always comfortable. This shoes feels like I am starting on rocks. I know it is too late but I want to return it. I can't wear it anymore.": "1", "Shies very stiff very narrow and sized long. I'm a 12 in ultraboost exchange to 11.5 and still 3/4 inch too long and so narrow couldn't even get my foot in comfortably on top of shoe sole so stiff and hard couldn't see them comfortable even if they fit": "1", "First off the delivery came sooner than expected. The shoe fits perfect. I am flat footed and I wore this shoe all day with no problem!": "5", "As always, Adidas comes through with consistent sizing and fit.  It's rare that I have to size up or down in Adidas.  I can order their shoes online and count on them fitting properly. These shoes are comfortable for all day wear and for running.": "5", "Thought this was tacky looking. Due to the plastic looking side logo. But when I put it on! Felt right!!!!": "3", "Adidas has the best combo of fit/comfort/price.  Their shoes rock.": "5", "Bought for my dad because of the comfort and great arch support": "4", "I'm on my feet 10 hours a day at work and these shoes help my comfortability tremendously!": "4", "Can be worn with jeans or khaki pants. They look really well.": "5", "I purchased these as my son's first adidas pair.

Response SR cushion great all around and love how lightweight they are. I bought 2.pair in 2 differ colors. Wish they had more diverse color options.....I  would prolly buy more!!!!Fast shipping, great packaging... no complaints.": "5", "These shoes a perfect for daily/going around town wear. Comfortable and a simple good look. I usually wear a 14 in sneakers, these were slightly big on me in a 14. They could be a tad bit wider but I have a flat wide foot.

Returned them and purchased a pair of Ultra Boost which are super comfortable and a perfect fit.": "2", "Stylish running shoes that fit great and are comfortable.": "5", "Not very cushioned.

Just not quite as much support as compared to other adidas shoes that I've had before.": "4", "Pleased! Great comfort! Looks good to! Would do it again! Great buy!": "5", "They are amazingly comfortable for long hours and working out.": "5", "Ok, I'm gonna admit something: I bought these solely because I loved the design/colors.

So comfortable": "5", "Fits perfect, very comfortable and affordable.": "5", "I haven't worn the shoes yet but I'm looking forward to wearing them": "4", "They fit great. Very well made. But I've been having heel problems since I starting wearing this, which I've never had before.": "4", "This shoe has absolutely changed my tennis for the better. It's lighter than the barricades but still the same support. On top of that, the boost on the side helps so much for lateral support. I highly recommend this shoe.": "5", "not comfortable, very tight on upper arch if you have normal arch. I had to use a norm tool to stretch it.  maybe okay for flat feet.": "1", "Like most Adidas tennis shoes, they work well for me as I play 3-4 times a week.  They last and they are very comfortable.": "4", "seam came off in one light session. Is not expected from adidas or experienced in any shoe ever bought (atleast bought 50 pairs so far including adidas ubersonic 3.0 etc). Same thing on both shoes. Has to be some manufacturing defect or may have been stored for too long and have become brittle?I am a big user and proponent of Adidas on the tennis circuit but case is bizzare and dissapointing. Please see photo attachedPls see if possible to refund or can i get another model?": "1", "Adidas solecourt boost tennis shoes are really comfortable and durable. Adidas quality is always great and has hit another home run with this tennis shoe!!": "5", "I really wanted to like these. High quality construction and a fit that I liked.

It is a very comfortable shoe.": "5", "These shoes were everything I expected, great fit and court traction.": "5", "Standardize all size of shoes , i change My last shoes because was so tight and this one are Big only half size more": "4", "I'm on my third pair of Solematch Bounce shoes and I can't seem to have enough of them. I play tennis 3-4 times a week and these shoes are top notch. I love the wide sole being that I had reconstruction surgery on one of my ankles and this shoe prevents me from rolling over. Can't wait for the next rendition of this shoe. Thanks Adidas!!!": "5", "I bought the shoe at a great price. The sole provides great comfort. However, the shoe is more wide than normal causing your foot to move around. I had to wear two pairs of socks to adjust to the wideness. Also, the lacing system does allow you to tighten it very hard. On the second to last loop on the top they added an eternal loop, but I am afraid if I tighten too hard, the loop will rip.": "3", "Make the lace up system better - too cumbersome. It takes too much time to get it laced up.": "4", "Perfect shoes to play tennis. Comfortable and convenient. Happy with my purchase.": "5", "Adidas should make more colorways of the solematch bounce. Good alternative to the boost version. Can't go wrong either way": "5", "I am 100% to recommending this product and use the Adidas app with friends and others": "5", "Purchased for hard court pickleball and tennis. Like the mesh upper, good tread.": "5", "Thank you for comfortable tennis shoes!! It's the best brand": "5", "I have a few pair of Adidas soul match shoes and like them very much.": "5", "So far I've tried a couple pairs of these shoes... They seem to be a nice replacement for the old Barricade lines that I used for years since the mid 2000s...": "5", "These shoes are a little clunky and big on the outside.  My biggest complaint is the laces are hard to loosen up and tighten due to the awkward eyelet placement": "3", "The SoleMatch Bounce are exactly what I was expecting them to be. There is plenty of cushion in the heel and they're wide through the middle of the shoe. The fit is just right and is true to size.These are definitely not the lightest tennis shoes I've ever had - they have some decent weight to them, so these aren't the shoes for you if you're looking for something very light weight.": "4", "The arch in this shoe is terribly misplaced and causes so much uncomfort that you cannot even walk. Really wanted to love this shoe, even tried on with a sole insert but had to return.": "1", "I enjoyed the color way, and comfortability of the shoe, but the durability seems off. After about 3-4 sessions on the court I noticed a rip on the heel next to the tongue. Going to see if I can exchange them for a different model.": "3", "Shoe is too narrow for the size. This is consistent with multiple reviews that unfortunately I chose to ignore.": "2", "Really durable and fits great. Would definitely recommend.

Many, many compliments - people want these shoes!": "5", "comfortable fit; looks great but size is a little bigger than usual 11.": "4", "I like the comfort.  The width was right for me. The color way is just very cool. The outsole seems to hold up well for tennis.": "4", "I like the appearance of the  the shoe and the price was within my budget": "5", "Good quality kicks with great colors and who cant like the 3 stripe logo. Slightly narrow and missing pull tab from the heel but other than that nice shoe.": "4", "Awesome shoes, from how they look to a really nice feel . Also, goes nice with everything .": "5", "The shoe is nice, but I do wish there was more contrast in color other than just black.": "5", "Not comfortable at all. I walk a lot at work and thought I needed to break them in but nope they hurt my feet in various places and I cannot wear them.": "1", "First day I wore these my feet hurt... second day... I could barley wall at the end of the day... these shoes are definitely not for the athletic paced person.": "1", "Nice looking shoe. Bold colors. Bought for comfort and they live up. Shoe seems on the bigger side. Foot moves around a bit when playing. Maybe should have sized down.": "4", "Really like the fit and form of this shoe. I use it to play badminton on our driveway, in this Covid situation.": "5", "Comfy and Super good looking I'd get a second pair.": "4", "I love the solematch bounce. They are comfortable and light but well-made and look really awesome. The extended little wing on the outside edge of the fore foot is well designed for tennis; this is an important area of the shoe where the foot can be over-strained by planting and pushing off, and adidas addresses this well.": "5", "As several reviewers have experienced, this shoe is uncomfortable while moving around on the tennis court. I had blisters on the instep of both my feet within one hour of wearing them. Just behind the pad of the big toe and the towards the inside of the foot, there is something in this shoe that sticks up and you feel there is a pike in the shoe that keeps rubbing against your foot. After an hour, I couldn't walk and would have rather played barefoot! The Ubersonic is too snug but won't cause any blisters.": "1", "Lacing system was simply too complex for a sport shoe that was going to be put on in all types of settings.": "3", "Very strong and comfy. It break in very quick and like to wear it daily": "4", "Tried the shoes on as soon as I could and they were a perfect fit! Hit the court and they provided the level of comfort and stability I needed.": "5", "Everything is good about the product except for the sole which is too narrow for me. The shoes have caused a blister on one end of both my feet. Photos are uploaded.": "4", "Thought these shoes looked amazing and they also had good cushion on the heel. However,  had to return because the instep on both feet would develop a blister. I went TTS, doublesocked and still had blisters. After 1 tennis session for 4 hours, I just wanted it to stopped. So i ended up returning these shoes. I think its best for narrow feet.": "2", "These were a little stiff at first, but my son has liked them overall. Built well.": "4", "The right shoe was a little narrower than the left as in comparison to previous Adidas purchases but eventually broke in. This is a great quality shoe after that hiccup": "5", "I like that it's black. Solid tennis shoes. Would have liked the grey stripes to be black too though.": "5", "Great stable shoe. Good looking too. But big for me": "4", "Fit all the criteria I was looking for in a tennis shoe.": "5", "I like this shoe because it has great support and comfort. This is my second pair and the third pair is not far away from being added to the collection.": "5", "I love this shoe... I am an all court player and this shoe helps me with speed and the ability to stop on a dime.": "5", "Light, supportive and hyper comfortable.

Not for wide feet.": "3", "Amazing show for Pickleball, low profile, to limit ankle roll. Re-enforced for good stability throughout the entire show.  Would definitely purchase again": "5", "This is a great show all around. Look, feel, and movement capability.": "5", "Shoe is good quality but is SO narrow. Really hurts my feet and is making them hard to break in. This is disappointing.": "3", "Really nice shoe, its not the softer shoe ever but its a good shoe.": "5", "Good shoe but a little tight across the top of the toebox": "4", "Great practice and on court training tennis shoe. I have a wider foot and regular arch and shoe feels good and is tru to size. Wish they kept the 6 month warranty, but other than that its a great tennis shoe.": "5", "Very comfortable and classy . Puts me in the right mood to play Tennis": "5", "only issue is difficulty lacing them up. Otherwise they are very comfortable": "4", "Too narrow in toe and top to bottom but better than other recent models.": "3", "Great value, great quality; most importantly great performance!": "5", "These shoes are comfortable and fashionable! Personally, I think that Adidas makes some of the best tennis shoes around!": "4", "Its great but probably won't last more than 2 or 3 months.  The pic online shows flat black on the side flare and its glossy black which is not good.": "4", "VERY GOOD PRODUCT, JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO WIDE. I would recommend buying .5 size smaller than usual.": "4", "Great for the player who likes the low to the court feel. This is a competition shoe. The fit and lockdown are among the best I've ever felt in an Adidas tennis specific shoe. There is more cushioning in the SoleCourt Bounce, so I'm going with it. I like more cushioning than this shoe offers, especially under the ball of the foot.": "4", "I love the security the shoes give while in a real tennis match.": "4", "This product is not hard to handle and very comfortable.": "4", "Nice grip on court.

Be colors are great.": "3", "I like them. It would be a five most likely after I break them in.": "4", "I used it for 3 hours in hardcourt and it bruised by foot so bad.": "1", "Having been a Game Court wearer, this SoleMatch was a massive upgrade to my delight. With the additional protection around the toe, no more will I worry about ripping holes on my attempts to slide on our hard courts. The upgraded midsole took my comfort to the next level and darn near mimic my comfort in my Ultraboosts. Great shoes through and through!!": "5", "So Far, Excellent Construction, Comfortable and has a unique midsole that extents out to prevent ankle sprains.": "5", "This shoe provides great comfort and stability on the court, right out of the box. I just ordered two more pairs to make sure I'll have extras once my first pair wears out.": "5", "I've worn Barricade Clubs for many years and was bummed that model's discontinued.  But this SoleMatch Bounce model seems like a very good replacement.  They came pre-laced in such a way that made them hard to put on, but once on they are comfortable, supportive, and played great with no break-in required.  I am a 4.0 all-court player.": "4", "Wore this once. Played for 3 hours. Was comfortable right away.": "5", "Gives you great stability during activity. They also have good arch support.": "4", "Sole is holding up nicely on the very griddy paddle tennis court.": "5", "comfortable fit and good pricing. definitely recommended": "4", "I'm a fan of Adidas because of the support during paddleball court play, comfort and stylish.

It happened the second time I played with this shoe. You can see the dent (circled) on the insole with matches the circled location on the exterior of the shoe.This is a beautiful shoe and I was very excited about it, however I had to stop my match due to foot pain. When I checked my foot there was abrasion on my skin too.That prominence simply presses against internal side of shoe, and need modification.": "2", "This shoe is garbage. It's like they installed two hard bumps in the back of each of your heel. This might be the most uncomfortable shoe I've ever worn.": "1", "Excellent fit and comfortable. Good for indoor volleyball.": "5", "One of the most suitable shoes for handball from my personal experience": "5", "Shoe looks and feels great.

They feel solid and design looks so good, the orange in the bottom gives a good pop. They stretched a bit on width but still feel a little tight. Otherwise they're great.": "4", "Very comfortable and great stability. These shoes are perfect for racquetball.": "5", "No \"breaking in\" problems for me. First of all, the shoe is stunning and comfortable. I play volleyball a lot and definitely keeps my feet stable": "5", "Good shoes, my nephew said they were very comfortable , he is 6'2 and plays vollyball": "5", "I love the comfort of this item and it is very nice love the material and look of this sneakers": "5", "Good quality, small fit, doesn't seem to scream adidas": "3", "it is very difficult to get the shoes on as it is very tight form the ancle side. Nonetheless, when the shoes is on, you feel that it is like an extension to your foot. one thing though I found to be a bit odd is the peripheral structure of the sole. it feels like the shoes want to push you foot towards an angle that is inclined towards the inside. As for the size, i use 44 and purchased the same size as the shoes I had (previous generation stabil) and found out that the new one is a bit tight. like a bit only. I strongly recommend that you would try the shoes in the shop before purchasing and I would recommend this product as it looks so futuristic and feels likewise. I have to try though :)": "4", "I love these shoes, however the back of my heel always hurts after a few hours. They tend to dig in a lil thats the only downside.": "5", "I would purchase sane brand nexI time.I would purchase the same brand next time.": "5", "Good look and quality but uncomfortable when you have to put the shoe on your foot, same to take off.": "3", "Is just an uncomfortable sneaker. I have more than 10 pairs of Adidas Sneakers and this pair if by far the most uncomfortable. Sorry Adidas, I still love you.": "2", "They hit all the check marks in my book. Great stability and overall comfort!": "5", "Perfect size and shape and color and brand and aaaaa": "5", "I bout these for a work out shoe and within one day the loop in the back to help slide your foot in with broke off because of bad stictchingbor something.The built in sock is too tall and when bending your foot, it cuts into your leg.The middle section of the shoe has no give and adjusting the laces cannot improve this.Very disappointed": "1", "Ok great looks to be sure they're Adidas and meet expectations": "5", "My son loves this shoe.  States it is very comfortable, functional and fun": "5", "they are perfect for the gym and also for everyday use": "5", "This product allows me to comfortably do physical task while showing off an amazing sense of style": "5", "For volleyball these are fantastic. Great grip on the floor and lightweight make for quick movements. Also, the combination of great arch support and a sock-like feel of the upper makes them super comfortable as well. 11/10 :) I already got one of my teammates to buy a pair!": "5", "Size and width are perfect. Very nice shoe. Would recommend this purchase.": "5", "Great shoes but a little bit narrow. I still recommend the shoes.": "4", "Love the feel it gives my little feet's yessssssss": "4", "Was really excited for this shoe. Have many other boost shoes however this one was a major disappointment. The fit is so narrow it's painful. The \"boost\" insert in nonexistent and the ground feels harder than being barefoot. I had hope of using this for for HIIT workouts since it's marked for sports that use directional stability but sadly it doesn't fit the bill.The quality is still top notch, but the fit kills it.Had to return.": "2", "The design of this shoe really caught my eye and I love it": "5", "The shoes very very comfortable. Nice fit and look stylish. Great for basketball or hanging out.": "5", "Slightly hard to wear and remove (I guess with time using it, it will loosen up a bit) but great fit and holding the ankle. Love the design": "4", "Very comfortable, a little tight on the top of the foot which became uncomfortable after a while but awesome ankle support.": "5", "A little tough to put on at first,  but worth it for the snug, laceless fit.": "4", "The plastic heel cup digs into Achilles' tendon and creates a sore rear heel.  Had to change shoes after 1.5hrs of playtime.": "1", "Got my side feet skin off because it's too narrow.": "2", "Good shoes. They hold together well and give good support while playing.": "4", "Very hard to put on. Very narrow and tight all around. Hard to move foot.": "3", "I love the clean look of these shoes! They fit like a glove.": "5", "NIce shoe but tough to get on even with the shoe horn.": "4", "Love this shoe. I have 2 pair now. The styling the fit and finish the comfort. What else is there? Nothing.": "5", "Great shoes but I little tough to wear the entire day": "5", "These shoes are so amazing, they fit just perfectly. They have such great grip on the hard courts and they work even better on the clay courts, I would definitely recommend these.": "5", "I love the look and the feel. Not super uncomfortable but perfect for match play!": "4", "The look is great, the slip on style I love, a little difficult to put on. I wore them 7 straight days of tennis and got crazy bad blisters within the first day on my heels. I'm a big boy so I play through the pain. But it's almost unbearable. Wish they were more comfortable. That ish hurting.": "2", "Would love to see an all black upper and solar red sole.solar red stripes would be ok too": "5", "My son loves them. He is a shoe fanatic. It is ridiculous that you require a long review text.": "5", "Too much tight. Was not for my feet. So i wont order that model": "5", "They look great, unfortunately they are very uncomfortable to use. Not only to put them on but also once you are playing.Good try but next time pay extra attention to the shoe sole since is very hard.": "3", "Nice appearance and I love how it keeps the clay out and off my socks!": "5", "Laceless!!!!!!! very comfortable, I recommend this product": "5", "very hard to get on / off difficult tough to put on and off": "4", "Great shoe, quality is amazing and its durable. However, it runs big !!! fit me kinda big, I got a 10.5 but I should've done like a 9.5 0r 10.": "4", "They are extremely difficult to wear. Unlike the predators.": "1", "I purchased these roughly 3 months ago and just ordered another pair (my current pair are locked in my office building due to covid). These are by far the best hard court shoes I have ever worn. People complain that they are difficult to get on, but most likely they are not bothering to use the included shoe horn which makes slipping them on a breeze. I find getting them off to be only slightly difficult with a sweated in sock, but it's like that for any shoe with or without laces. The shoes may look big on your feet the first time you put them on but you won't notice it after a minute or two playing in them. I can't recommend these shoes enough and many of my friends are now converters as well. Try these and I promise you'll never want to buy a tennis shoe with laces again!": "5", "Do not recommend -The shoes are way too tight almost impossible to put on and I ordered them in the size that I normally order from Adidas and where without any trouble.": "2", "I read that a lot people said they are too tight. I bought a pair anyway. They are tight, but it's kinda what you want if you are going to be active in them. I'm sure after the break in period that they will spectacular. It's a well made shoe to be active in. They look cool too!": "4", "Really good fit. Feels like a glove. Takes getting used to, but once you get used to it it works just fine! Takes getting used to the weight as well.": "5", "They feel just like the barricades. So easy to slip on. Love them": "5", "I like how they support tour foot but they are pretty tight.": "4", "Easy to put on yet stays tight around my foot. absolutely practical and easy": "4", "Love the comfort however the shoe looks long on your feet": "4", "incredible support, great design. have reccommended": "5", "These shoes really surprised me! I got them because they look awesome! But I wasn't expecting to perform that great. Since tennis is mostly side-to-side movement, the lateral support is very important. I have to say they impressed me! The only critique I have is when you really have to push off and recover back as quickly as possible you can feel your feet slide a bit up the side wall of the shoe, but I never felt in danger of rolling my ankle or anything. Overall I would say if I was still playing at the D1 level I would probably stick with laces, but for the coaching and playing that I do now they work great!": "4", "overall it's a great shoe. just the tongue feels/ seem short. so it barely tops your instep or reaches your ankle. other than that it's a great everyday/ running shoe!": "4", "I use this shoe for daily mileage and slow recovery days. It feels just comfortable enough and is very kind to my feet!": "5", "Love these, fit awesome very comfortable shipping was very fast, might get another pair in different color.": "5", "I recommend this shoes wearing  comfortable and sizes is true.": "5", "Best shoes I've owned in a long time.  Fit great.  Look good.": "5", "Got these for the hubs as he likes flashy sneakers.  They look great and he says they're very comfortable.": "5", "The color is easy to match outfits! Easy running shoes to slip on and go anytime. Do fit more snug than some other running shoes": "4", "Would definitely buy another pair for work all year round": "5", "11.5 shoe fit very good.  All standard width shoes are a bit wide on my narrow foot but these seem to run narrower so I don't have to pull the laces so tight.  This is my 3rd pair of Supernovas.": "5", "Overall the best training shoes, I like that it's recycled": "5", "The shoes look nice. Also comfortable during long runs.": "4", "Popped them and perfect fit.  Im lucky as sometime Adidas run narrow.": "5", "All was good, but the ankle could have been taller.": "4", "These shoes are very disappointing. They looked cool, but when they arrived, the height of the heel looked too high. I gave them a shot anyway. After two months of running, I wish I had bought something else. They are like running on a thick, inclined cushion with a narrow toe bed. My foot constantly slides down and bangs against the front.  Couple with the narrow toe bed that does not allow proper toe splay, these are a major disappointment.": "1", "Best price for what its worth. Overall i enjoyed the shoes": "5", "Going to purchase again in another colorway. I really like these shoes, gonna workout in them!": "5", "Buy them they will treat you well on every run where ever u at": "5", "I was running in Adidas Response Cushions for many years. Those must have disappeared, so I tried other ones, and another brand. These shoes are most like Response, and I'm so happy and excited. My comfortable running is back after a few years!": "5", "They are comfortable for running, bu the tongue kept wanting to slide down as I walked for ran.": "4", "Not enough ankle support to be honest. But overall a great shoe.": "4", "This shoe looks and feels great! Catchy color and super comfortable.": "5", "Great product for everyday wear and for a morning run.": "4", "Will definitely buy again, love the style and the sleek look.": "4", "Good daily shoes. I expect to get a year or good wear in them.": "5", "extremely comfortable, reasonably priced and delivery was fast": "4", "Great shoe but width is slightly narrow. Maybe a size up is advised for better comfort. However, delivers on absorbing shock from each strike force on the tarmac.": "4", "have bought this same shoe for the past seven years.": "5", "Really like the shoe. Not quite as squishy as some of the highest end Adidas shoes, but much more lower priced. A great knock around shoe that could handle structured runs if needed.": "4", "I love this shoe. Fits my foot almost perfectly. Looks awesome on the foot and at the price they are more than worth it.": "5", "Two-three years ago I had several pairs of the Supernovas that I wore every winter because they maintained their softness in sub-freezing weather.  This present shoe is not as soft.  I believe it has something to do with the amount of boost material.  Was Adidas trying to make the shoe/model lighter so they used less boost material?  Unfortunately, that was a deal breaker for me.  Adidas was my first running shoe in 1973 and through the 1980s.": "3", "Great for exercising! I needed some shoes that were comfortable and light with good support and these worked great.": "5", "Nice fit and good quality very comfortable and looking forward for more shoes like this": "5", "These fit perfect, they look cool, and are sturdy for a workout.": "5", "The inner liner is supposed to come out, but it's not supposed to peel away off and fold up on itself. It seems to have gotten caught on the heel liner, which then makes it fold in on itself and as you walk it creeps further and further down and soon there's no liner by your toes. This happened within the first few weeks of getting the shoes. Not happy at all.": "1", "The quality of the shoe is great. The only (slight) problem I have is the the upper part of the shoe is a little constructive for a running shoe. They really dig into the top of your foot for the first few days, but when broken in, they are great shoes. Overall, I would recommend buying them, but be prepared to break them in before any serious running.": "4", "Supportive and a good bounce when running in these.": "5", "Have no idea. The big toe doesn't fit. I need to exchange.": "3", "Supernova is one of my favorite Adidas models of shoes  and this pair didn't disappoint. I'm a PE teacher and theses shoes are perfect for my teaching. Love them!": "5", "This is the best choice if you don't want to spend a lot on a running shoes that you have to replace every 500 miles. Just wish it had reflective elements on it as the winter version of supernova does.": "5", "Like the way it looks and feels.  Plain shoe but has comfort.  Great Price too.": "4", "Bought for Lil brother. He said they fit well and are comfortable. Got him doing different running drills. Says they work.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe, but it was too narrow for my feet. If you fit more narrow sized shoe, then these would work wonders. Too bad I won't be able to feel like that.": "4", "Great shoes for everyday wear; well cushioned with great fit and style": "5", "I was a little disappointed. They're much more narrow than reviews said and very stiff. Maybe im just too used to having boost on the whole sole and not just in the heel. They're good for everyday stuff like getting groceries and whatnot but they're not the kind of shoe I like to run in.": "3", "My son loves these shoes.  These are training shoes for high school track and loves the comfort.": "5", "The forefoot and heel are very well padded and comfortable. Easy to wear these all day.": "5", "This is my 3rd pair of Supernova's since my running store analyzed by gait and I switched to this shoe.  And like the first 2, the new pair does not disappoint.  Very comfortable shoe.": "5", "Perfect fit and very comfortable! Highly recommend!": "5", "I use the shoe mostly for work. Feels great during the day.": "5", "These are a good entry level running shoes if your new to running and don't want to spend the premium price for a running shoe.  Has boost in the heel and continental rubber outsole.": "4", "Excellent comfortable shoes. Best shoes for running and walking": "5", "These are exactly what I was looking for. Most comfortable shoes I own.": "5", "Great price for a great shoe! The shoe looks great with jeans, shorts and track pants.": "5", "I purchased these shoes a few months ago and they are perfect!": "5", "I currently really like the \"Solardrive\" shoes that are no longer in production.  I have also always liked the \"Supernova\" line of shoes that Adidas has produced in the past.  These are similar to the Solardrives but with less cushioning.  I would suggest this shoe to a lighter runner or someone doing more \"uptempo\" or \"speed\" work.": "4", "Cheap materials and construction. They do not look as nice in person as they do in the photos.": "3", "These shoes are comfy for about 20 miles, then all you get is pain": "5", "I ordered a size 9 and since I have a narrow foot these shoes fit perfectly both in length and width. Quite comfortable since I'm on my feet all day.": "5", "Design was good! Very comfortable,  easy to run. But I am afraid to dirty easily.": "4", "I got these to match my grey and orange sweat suit. I love them! Soooo comfy.": "5", "I bought these for my son who runs marathons (including the Olympic Marathon Team Trials in February 2020 in Atlanta - excuse me for being a proud mom). Back to these awesome shoes - my son runs in these shoes every day because he likes them the best for getting out on the road and just running. He has run in them for years. In fact, he always likes to have backups for these shoes so he usually has several pairs at the ready!": "5", "Very stable shoe for a clean soft ride. Good toe heel toe run.": "5", "Good balance of cushion and support. Not too much cushion and not too rigid.": "5", "It is super comfortable and it feels so good to walk and run in. Color is unique.": "5", "I like the idea of a hybrid cushioning for responsiveness in a \"faster\" shoe, but the shoe felt flat. The Boost in the heel doesn't feel as cushioned as the Solarboost (preferred shoe right now). Maybe there is less Boost or a different grade? The Bounce is a little harsh to my liking. This might be a better summer shoe?": "3", "These are great running shoes for the every day runner. The are comfortable and supportive.": "5", "Great shoe for everyday use for those who like to rock the sneaker look 24/7": "5", "I am very happy with my purchase. These shoes are absolutely phenomenal for my size. They have significant heel support.": "5", "Shoe looks and feels great. Very sleek looking. I would recommend this to a friend.": "5", "I was looking for a good pair of running shoes and these are perfect. The boost technology on the back makes the ride very comfortable. The bounce technology gives you a great bit of response when running. If you do not want to break the bank for a great pair of running shoes, then I really recommend these!": "5", "I use this as my going back and forward to work I been wearing them a week and they are very comfortable.": "5", "I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them!": "5", "Nice shoes with good quality and best price. I it very much": "5", "I would like to send these back and get a sizd 13  in place of the 12.5Not sure how to return them and get the 13's": "1", "Very beautiful, the spectacular color should adidas get more of these colors, but the most important thing is the quality and the comfort you can walk with them for hours and not get tired !!!  in other words they are perfect": "5", "They look awesome but run a little to big so if they are something that you would like to buy go a 1/2 smaller I compared  to all my othee addidas and they are way bigger.": "4", "how do I returnThese run very big. I need to return for a smaller size": "4", "Gift for my wife's son.....he loves themHe is a shoe freak": "5", "I had originally bought the shoes because of the color, but they are very comfortable.

I use them when bike riding or playing tennis for a bright colorful option.": "5", "This is the first Adidas shoe which I had to return because it was too narrow. Very uncomfortable": "2", "good fit and comfortable shoes to wear daily. Breaths well.": "5", "Very comfortable! Fit perfectly.  Light weight. Definitely will get more.": "5", "Got these because I wanted more lateral support than I get from my UB19.

Great value.  Boost cushioning felt springy.": "2", "This shoe has a very soft insole. It is also very durable!": "5", "Love the color wanted to represent cancer awareness as im battling esophageal cancer.": "5", "Shoes are great for walking. They are comfortable but husband did not supportive enough for his running.": "5", "You got to love Adidas. Great products and better price.

Comfortable and lightweight": "5", "Highly recommend.This is an amazing pair of shoes.": "5", "These are a very good shoe; very good quality and very comfortable.  I'm interested to see how durable they are.": "5", "Just the right thing, I was looking for, great comfort and color and the classic adidas style.": "5", "Very bouncy shoes. Great for workouts.

I absolutely love them!": "5", "I recommend these shoes to everyoneThey fit perfectly and are very comfortableThanks adidas": "5", "I have had several pairs of Supernovas since 1997 and this one feels great and reminds me of the comfort I felt with the first pair.

I wear them to coach high school basketball. Very breathable, comfortable. Great shoe!": "5", "Would definitely recommend to anyone! Amazing purchase!": "5", "I walked in them for the first time. The shoes are soft and comfy. But my toes hurt after hiking in them. I feel the top is too thin, not a lot of protection from objects. It's somewhat average": "4", "This is the 2nd pair I've purchased. Couldn't be happier. Fits perfect. True to size. Super comfortable.": "5", "Great shoe, only draw back is the tongue does not have slot for laces. Tongue slides forward when putting shows on.": "4", "Fit really good i would recommend to anyone looking for running shoe": "5", "For the price you can't go wrong with these classics": "5", "Really nice lightweight sneakers that are just snug and work really well when you are on your feet all day.": "5", "Love these shoes. Have put over 200 miles in work them. No complaints.": "5", "The size is not RIGHT at alllllllllllllllllllllllll": "4", "Was excited for the shoes at a great price, but the size was quite large. 10.5 is my normal size but this arrived and fit more like an 11.5. The heel was a little roomy but may have been due to sizing. Cushion in heel was good, toebox being bounce I wasn't a huge fan of, love my boost now. Sadly had to return the shoes.": "3", "Perfect casual shoe.  The boost cushion on the heel helped eliminate the pain and discomfort in my left heel.": "4", "Good quality shoe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "4", "I got this for my nephew for this Christmas.

Would buy these shoes in multiple colors": "5", "I love the structure and the fabric. Very comfortable and love the color too": "5", "Shoes are comfortable, was looking for more of a burnt orange rather that highlighter orange but these are still great shoes to go running in.": "5", "I tryly love it and recommend for those who enjoynrunning": "5", "These are bright orange and so eye-catching! They are perfect for a jog in the sun. I probably will try to avoid rainy days so I can keep them clean and colorful. Actually, they are also very fashionable for a casual night out, too! I can't wait to dance in these.": "5", "I love that these combine a boost and bounce sole, so they're not as expensive as all boost soles, but they're just as comfortable for great performance.  I had them in the neonish pink color, and also wanted a lime green, but I got these since they didn't have the green I wanted.  They're great and I primarily wear them when walking on a cement floor for 3-4 hours straight.": "5", "The color is just the right orange I was looking for. They offer grey support and the fit is just right!": "5", "Great shoes great design they are comfy I really like it": "5", "I'm on my feet all day long and these shoes are so comfortable!! I love them more than my Ultraboost": "5", "Good and response trainers. Not heavy but with the integrity to hold up for kilometers. Comfortable shoes with the added benefit in that the product is constructed with recycled primegreen materials.": "4", "The color Orange that was Delivered was much brighter and fluorescent looking than the online photo.    Sadly sent them back.": "2", "Got these shoes for my husband. They arrived on time. They fit perfectly, are true to size and are supremely comfortable. He loves them! I do wish there were other colors in this style though!": "5", "My husband has worn the supernovas for years. Adidas has changed this style so now the tongue of the shoe is held in place by wide elastic bands. Makes the shoe hard to get on and makes your foot feel squeezed. They went back right away.": "2", "super comfy, highly recommend. Will be purchasing again": "5", "Always love my three stripes! Only shoe that fits my feet!!": "4", "They are so comfortable and I love them.  My mom loves hers as well": "5", "Really eye catcher, loved the color combination and it's super comfortable": "5", "Bought these shoes for my parents, both mother and father. They say probably the comfiest shoes they own.": "5", "Women sizes run larger than indicated (7.5 fit like an 8.5). Returned correct size; yet, oversized shoes and waiting for a 6.5 to be in-stock and see what happens": "3", "I never have to worry about quality and comfort. My expectations are always met.": "5", "Bought these shoes on a whim and am very pleased with my purchase.  In the first week I had them, I ran in them, did a HIT workout, and also hit a trail and they are very comfortable.  Very nice replacement for my previous pair of shoes (non Adidas!).": "5", "Ligament damage in both feet so can no longer run. Walk each day and these feel great.": "5", "I expected the supernovas to have more cushioning and be more suitable for running slightly longer distances. There was a lot of impact that would transfer into my shins. Good  lightweight shoe for shorter distances, but not for longer runs.": "3", "This review is from right out of the box. I have yet to actually run or do any exercise in these shoes yet. My first impression of these shoes are they seem like a downgrade from the Supernovas I remember from the past.I went up a half size when I ordered these shoes so you might want to consider that if you're considering these shoes. A half size larger fit perfect on me. The width seems a slight narrow. Not a huge deal but a half size larger might be beneficial to you. They seem a little stiff out of the box. Comfortable but not as comfortable as I remember past Supernovas. The materials used seem cheap to me. I own many different models of Adidas and the quality on a lot of them are much better than these. To me, they just don't seem to meet the standards of past Supernovas.The tread on the shoe has the look and feel of a lesser model running shoe. They feel hard and has a plastic feel to it. The tongue of the shoe is already annoying me a little with only wearing them a few hours. There is no lace loop on them and when I walk the tongue keeps sliding down. It's not a deal breaker, just something I noticed.As I wear these more I am hoping they break in and because more comfortable. So far they're just ok and I am happy I didn't pay full price for these shoes and got them at a deep discount. I'm a little disappointed with these Supernova shoes having Supernovas in the past. I'll try to give an update as I wear them more.": "4", "Comfortable, nice. Makes walk/running easy.givesa little bounce to each step.": "5", "A great comfortable sneaker love the colo choices all purpose for running and walking.": "5", "For some reason this model feels lighter than previous generations, like the weight is more uniform or was redistributed. The fit is above average on both feet, which is great when one foot has a bit of a higher arch than the other. I can barely feel the construction above the lower metatarsels on either side of the  shoe tongue, which is normally a big complaint, but the sensation fades through the ride which is not always true of all shoes.": "4", "The Supernovas are a comfortable, all around good shoe. I do wish it could be tighter around the ankle when tied.": "5", "The quality and comfort of this shoe is great! A lot of arch and sole support and I also wear it to strength train so the shoe itself is pretty versatile.": "5", "Great running shoe. Good stability and excellent heel cushioning.": "5", "Beautiful looking shoe, but unusable for me. Fit was extremely narrow and tongue design was flawed, such that is emphasized the narrowness.": "2", "I've worn Supernovas for years. They've always fit great and been durable. I'm very happy they are back.": "5", "I have these as a gift and they loved them. They fit true to size and are very comfortable!": "5", "Once I put these shoes on, I knew I made the right choice. Super comfortable and a perfect fit for my feet. These shoes also gladly accepted my orthopedic insoles and it feels like I'm walking on clouds.": "5", "I love these shoes. The color is eye-catching and always gets comments. I read reviews that it was not as pink as the website shows, but in fact in my opinion it is even more vibrant in person. The shoes are way more comfortable than I thought. I love the tongue and feel of the shoe, and this is the most comfortable shoe I have worn from adidas. Absolutely recommend.": "5", "The new color is amazing and the fit just right! I highly recommend!": "5", "Crazy comfortable. Perfect running shoes for me, grey on Grey everything": "5", "Comfortable for running and hanging out with ...not a bad option": "5", "Comfortable, casual , athletic. This is a good all around shoe": "5", "Feels amazing on runs and very supportive. The quality is great": "4", "Just went for my first run with these today and for the price, they're absolute winners.": "5", "These are good solid shoes.  Not the SuperNova of old, Those were rock solid, great workout shoes.  And were a bit heavy.  This one is not heavy.  Good shoe but I need something with a bit more padding under the ball of my foot for the long workouts.  This works well for my 3 - 4 mile outings.  It does not have the spring/cushion  of the some of the other bounce line shoes like the Solar Glide.  Still a great shoe and works well for me for the workouts I use it for.  Wears well so far.  Comfortable and fits well.  Has nice arch support and flexibility.  Uppers are durable and easy to clean.  Traction is good on paved surfaces.": "4", "Very supportive with a great cushioned heel and toe box. I walk approximately 8 miles a day and I can usually get about 5-6 months' wear from this shoe.": "5", "Great for running and for the gym. Show is also a great style to rock casually": "5", "I really love the color of these shoes. They fit perfectly like all of my Adidas collection.": "5", "The Adidas Supernova line has been my go-to running shoe for well over a decade. This pair exhibits the same quality and performance that I love with each pair! Good support, cushion and comfort without weight or bulk. Sure to get plenty of good miles out of these!": "5", "I run 6 miles every other day on my treadmill. The shoes feel great and very comfortable during my runs.": "5", "Not as comfortable as the ultra boosts but good for regular jogging": "4", "Like the design and style the negative was the shoe ran small and narrow.": "3", "These are super lightweight so they make a great pair of running shoes. I was hesitant about getting them but I'm glad I did it. You won't be disappointed.": "5", "Shoe seems to be a little narrower and shorter than usual": "4", "I have had a lot of Ultra Boost shoes and decided to give this one a try and it doesn't disappoint point me. Recommend this shoe to every runner.": "5", "Well balanced training shoe a good choice for running 5 to 7 miles a day": "5", "Fits perfectly and very comfortable. I have a wide foot and there's no issues at all.Perfect for jogging": "5", "Really lovely bounce in the sole. Perfect for cardioblast/dumbbell classes I attend. A bit of running with lots of squats and jumps!": "5", "It seems like it's taking a while to break in properly or my feet to get used to them.  But I've only used them for about 10 miles.  The sole provides good cushion.  The upper is pretty thick, quality material, but pretty stiff in first uses.  Should be a good winter walking/running shoe for me as I continue to break in.  Overall I am pleased with the shoe thus far.": "4", "Very lightweight and easy on the feet. Pretty comfy too.": "4", "The shoes have very good cushioning and support. I have a lot less strain on my legs while running in the supernovas compared to other running shoes.": "5", "Well made and comfy right out of the box.   Looks great.": "5", "Great quality, very comfortable and breathable. The pink color really stands out and I get many compliments.": "5", "Started running recently and needed a comfy shoe to protect my knees. After much review the supernova seemed to be a great compromise. Tried them on when they arrived and the comfort was amazing. Can't recommend more": "5", "The tongue of the shoe has excess material between the first and second row of lace holes.  This resulted in mild irritation of the top of my foot during a long run.  The excess material makes a little depression.  I tried to pull it flat by pulling the top of the tongues towards my legs but it wouldn't flatten.": "4", "First purchase in a while and happy I did. Great style and lightweight.": "5", "I'm on my feet all day and these shoes are super comfortable and also grab a lot of attention": "5", "Look way cooler in person. Great shoe and great to run in. Very light. Tongue is off to the side which makes the fit a little weird but still a great show": "5", "These shoes fit great and are super comfortable and lightweight": "5", "I can wear these shoes all day at work or for a few miles on the treadmill.": "5", "I love this shoe, so comfortable. The fit is true and I like the clean look.": "5", "Good shoe overall - comfortable and stable while running": "4", "Wish description indicated it was fluorescent orange. OK for some but too much for me.": "2", "Shoes color is what got me to purchase, turned out to be great comfortable shoes": "5", "A big step up from my current shoe. Great for jogging.": "5", "I have been wearing Adidas shoes since the 1960's (I still wear my Mexicana training shoes) and this is another great shoe continuing in the Supernova tradition! Great comfort and even better cushioning make this a great shoe for everyday training.": "5", "Great design, great fit. Love these shoes. Wish the color was more on the pink side though.": "5", "Great running shoe and very comfortable for a daily driver. Comes true to size. Signal Pink is a fly color way.": "5", "Good purchase, however a bit pricy also a little low for me": "4", "There made very well and fit like a glove i would definitely recommend this shoe": "5", "Shoes are nice just disappointed that the quality isn't great": "2", "Perfect im buy for my love \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb": "5", "Very comfortable shoes, keep your feet cool and fresh": "5", "Like the grip!  To loose in nose for downhill. Foot lateral movement feels unstable.  My foot may just be to narrow for wide front of shoe": "3", "I work in a warehouse and on my feet all day on cement. These shoes are amazing ! Terrific arch support ... just wide enough in the toe box ... and enough cushion to keep my feet comfortable all day. I love these shoes !! Definitely my go to shoe out of a closet of 20+ pair.": "5", "The shoes are good looking and great quality,my best purchase in recent times": "5", "Long distances on bad surfaces? These shoes will make it. Long-lasting, but not as comfortable as the regular Ultra Boost. The soles are so much better than these of any competing products, it is a real advantage if you're out to win.": "5", "I have only had them for a couple of weeks, so far they are comfortable. I have not had a chance to go on a trail to test them out. I am sure they will perform.": "5", "Great looks and great fit.  Very happy with the purchase.": "4", "Would definitely buy another pair or another one like it": "5", "Comfy, overall pretty good. I bought for everyday casual look": "5", "Great trail shoes. The German Continental soles provide good traction and durability. I've worn Adidas for over 50 years. Thanks Adi Dassler!": "5", "Had these shoes for almost a month now. Pretty solid on easy trail runs, we'll see how they hold up": "5", "This is a break in shoe. The Arch is high and on the inside they will push in on your foot. After a few hours and a thicker sock you can push past it as they break in. Not very much bounce considering the shoe rocks you back on the heel the bounce should be better. Love the color splash, traction is great, not a bad shoe.": "4", "I really like the shoes.  I am training for my first marathon and the shoes are comfortable with good stability.": "5", "I ordered these shoes but don't wear them too much because they are simply to large.  Also very bright color that is a little much for me.": "5", "The colors pop really nice and they are made really well. They will last a very long time.": "5", "These were for my husband. He said they were just slightly wide, but otherwise loved everything about them!": "5", "I love the looks of this shoe. Finally, a design that doesn't have a massive white border around the shoe that gets dirty so easily. The thinner white border with a black sole is a much better. I hope more running shoes of this design come out soon. They are super comfortable right out of the box. But the \"sock\" enclosure needs to be more flexible. The shoes require two hands or a shoehorn to get on. I much prefer holes for the shoestrings. The loops have more friction and are more difficult to tighten.": "4", "Honestly the comfiest pair of shoes I've hiked they're lightweight and highly breathable!": "5", "All my workout gear is Adidas and I exclusively by their athletic shoes, but these are not what I expected considering the price.  I was shopping for a shoe with more support and these aren't it.  I also don't like the shoe tongue being sewn into the lace cage.  I like to tighten up my shoes when I run outdoors and this causes the tongue to bunch up.  I'll need to double check that on my next pair.  I kept them since I chose to try and break them in, rather than return them.": "3", "I enjoy these shoes a lot, I bought them to mainly play disc golf in. I figured they would be a lighter alternative to my other trail runners, and they have not let me down one bit They seem rugged enough for what I needed I just wish they offered more options with the ultra boost sole.": "4", "Overall this is a great product for most trails. i would go for something a little more sturdy for rockier hikes but for long distances this shoe is great": "5", "Shoes are OK, but compared to something like Ultraboost's they pale in comparison. These shoes don't have nearly the amount of cushion necessary to provide support for anything more than just walking, it's very easy to bottom these out.As for the ability to hug the foot, it's feels like the shoe doesn't hug your foot enough, the sensation that your foot wants to slide out and lacks support is quite high.Also, compared to something like an ultra boost, the airflow only these shoes is awful. My socks are practically soaked by the time I take them off after a day of office work.": "3", "But pretty good overall! I have to keep writing to make the character limit.": "4", "I've worn them solely for disc golf, but they are holding up pretty well so far": "5", "Best type of birthday gift to give. They remember you every time they wear their shoes!": "5", "I liked the look right out of the box. They were easy to put on the first time. I felt a bump in the wrong spot next to my arch which after one week has gone away. The top of the shoe distorts when you step on the floor. I have worn Adidas running shoes for the last 20 years and this is the first time they behaved this way. Overlooking these potential negatives, I really like the feel during running. I am not sure if I would buy them again but will be an Adidas fan for life.": "3", "It's what I need for the job I do. It's perfect the grip on the shoe is right on": "5", "I bought these on my birthday in December, as i wanted a comfortable and lightweight  shoes to go hiking with my dogs. So when i saw them i thought this is exactly what i am looking for. I go out everyday walking anywhere between 1.5hrs to 2 hrs. The longest hike i have done in them is 4 hours and i cant complain how great they have been. However we are in march and the sole has cracked on both shoes in the same place, on one shoe the crack is big enough that it had a pebble inside of it. I was expecting atleast 6 months wear out of these shoes not 3. Especially when the tag line for this product os light weight, durable gear.": "4", "I bought this pair of shoes for my husband he said these are so light and comfortable": "5", "I love the style and the design while I hate the fact that they fit large.": "4", "very versatile and comfortable product.  Nice color with just enough pop.": "5", "These are the most comfortable shoes that I have ever had. Great for running and hiking.": "5", "Because of the Quality............................": "5", "The full length boost midsole is quite comfortable but I would suggest going down half a size": "4", "Great shoe.  Comfortable and strong, great both for walking and hiking": "5", "The shoe is perfect for running on street and trail. Wish it had a little more cushioning but is still quite good. Great traction.": "5", "Great trail running shoes, but also for everyday use as well. What I dont like is arch support, it's too aggresive and the longer wear the more irritate my midfoot. Except this, rest is great, nice balance of ground feeling and cushioning, very comfortable upper.": "4", "I tried both the Agravic Flow and the Agravic XT. they are both comfortable and well-made. I am a consistent size 10 and while they both fit, the Agravic Flow is roomier. So if you like a thicker sock, or you are on the high side of size, the Agravic Flow would probably be more comfortable.": "5", "I would say that I have normal sized feet in terms of width and size. I ordered a size 11 and because of the no tongue design when lacing up, the upper material folds over creates very uncomfortable pressure points on the top part of my foot. Seems like they were designed for people with very large feet (not length wise).": "2", "Perfect for outdoor running. First time i have bought TERREX shoes and honestly i dont know  why. Awesome shoes": "5", "These are my first trail running shoes and I've been very happy with them so far. I've used them mostly for hikes and walks, but the few runs I've had with them, they were great. They held up nicely with snow and rain.": "5", "Another great shoe from Adidas. Comfortable out of the box, good support, not too stiff and I love the soles. My foot is on the narrower side and these shoes are great. I use them exclusively to play disc golf.": "5", "My boyfriend loved them! He has flat feet and they fit him perfectly.": "5", "Do not hesitate to buy this shoe if you are seeking all-around comfort in snow/rain/chilly weather. I have a 5 year old jack russell who must get an hour of exercise per day and he adores snowy wet conditions. This shoe is more than up to the task of keeping my feet dry and toasty as we trek through woods and fields. Adidas is the best quality for your money, without question.": "5", "I ran and tested these shoes in many scenarios and places: fall of last year, this winter, in the rain, trail running, Midwest (mild) cold and bitter cold, on slippery roads and sidewalks after a fresh now - and also WHILE it is now snowing hard here in Chicago.These shoes did not disappoint, and provided perfect and snow/water-proof traction, comfort, grip, and stability, throughout my 90 minute run. I DEFINITELY recommend.": "5", "good grip, lightweight. Could use a little more cushion in the sole but overall super dope": "5", "This is his third pair, perfect for work as well since the grip is great.   He wears them with casual clothes and to go in walks as well.  Perfect for every day": "5", "Shoe feels supportive and snug. I usually wear size 12.5 Adidas running shoes and exchanged these Terrex 350's which seemed to run a bit large but fit perfectly 1/2 size smaller. Great shoes!": "5", "Great traction and are waterproof but super stiff/flat.  I think I should have done a bit more research and found a more comfortable, goretex winter runner.": "3", "I bought then to replace and old pair of Adidas Goretex and I couldn't be happier with my choice the got a really good quality sole": "5", "I had high expectations for these shoes. However, the cushion it provides on hard surfaces is almost non-existent. It is possible that in trails, it might work better but, for the roads, it is no where close to any of my other adidas shoes in terms of comfort. Otherwise, the fit is good and it does keep the water away.": "3", "Great tread in the wet and keep your feet nice and dry": "5", "Solid shoe. This shoe feels purpose built. Although I will use it primarily as a lifestyle shoe I have confidence in wearing this when I am out on the trail and in rainy or any other wet conditions. Firm but flexible. Good quality. The ride on this shoe is stable. It is slightly heavier than most shoes but this is the reason why I bought this shoe. Third pair. I have other colors in this shoe.": "5", "Nice quality product, only the front design is not what I expected.Overall is a good product": "3", "The quality was very good because he wanted a pair that can be waterproof running through puddles & muddy trails. The fit was very comfortable.": "5", "Only slight complaint would be they are a little stiff/maybe need a little extra cushion. They definitely keep feet warm and dry": "4", "Perfect shoes... waterproof working and nice for running.": "5", "So comfortable, nice look has a great soul and really makes it worth your money": "5", "Love this shoe. It's waterproof. I need a comfortable waterproof shoe without the look like snowboard boots. This running shoe does it. Great look and waterproofing. My life is complete.": "5", "I bought these shoes primarily as a winter running shoe; something that can withstand a wet and cold Minnesota winter. As a running shoe, it's fine. A bit stiff but that is expected coming from a waterproof trail runner that is being used as a street running shoe. Only complaint as a running shoe is the insole isn't the greatest.As a trail shoe, it is great. No complaints. Good traction with the thick treads. And expected GORE-TEX quality keeps wet and muddy elements outside.": "4", "bought these for work shoes. haven't worn them enough to break them all the way in. but so far, they are nice.": "4", "These shoes are uncomfortable, they are very hard and they hurt my feet.": "1", "No worries about the quality of the shoe and the Gor Tex is the reason that you want these.": "5", "Quality seems good. My heel had a little discomfort, I think from a thin pad. Compared to the adidas running shoes I usually wear. Just really nice to have dry feet when I get back from walking through the fields I'm in.": "4", "Seems like they will last a while. Can't wait to see how waterproof they are.": "5", "The only suggestion for improvement would be the laces.  My old Adidas shoes had Lace Bungee laces.  I bought elastic lace/lock laces to replace the tie laces on my new shoes.": "4", "Very comfortable for long walks on trails or playing disc golf": "5", "i recc the shoe, it is comfortable and I needed a rugged shoe for hiking": "5", "Great protection your feet. Excellent shows for sand and lousy soil": "5", "Great pair of sneakers. Felt comfortable wearing them for my 5 mile walk. No pain or discomfort. Would highly recommend these for the upcoming winter since they are waterproof.": "5", "Ok for thick socks not sure yet about the wet   Sofas so good": "4", "Very comfortable and true to size. Got these for disc golf and they are perfect": "5", "Hi, I just received a pair of TERREX AGRAVIC GORE-TEX TRAIL RUNNING SHOES.  They are uncomfortable and I am returning them.  But I wanted to provide this feedback.  I have owned a lot of Adidas and they have always been a good fit and comfortable. But with these shoes there is a lot of material that folds under the tongue and rubs on the top of my foot.  It's a shame because in general it's a nice shoe otherwise. But I don't understand why all of this material is there when you need good comfort and fit for a performance shoe.": "2", "Awesome that's they're waterproof. Grip is great on every surface. Definitely recommend": "5", "One do the most comfortable shoes ever and great durability for a rough hiking as well.": "5", "It's an all terrain shoe, rugged and durable, new insoles help with comfort.": "4", "I use this shoes for 5'days and part took off easy! I don't know why! But am not happy": "4", "Consistent quality with other adidas products but insole does not align well with my arches.  Nowhere near as comfortable as other Terrex GTX Trail Runners I have purchased in the past.": "1", "Comfortable, good fit, lighter than I expected .  I'm looking forward to putting them through a test this fall.  So far they meet my expectations ! Happy with the purchase": "5", "Great for on the go, light weight and not ugly. The grippy soles are also good for those ventures into the woods.": "5", "Alright, Think I found my new favorite shoe. This is my first  trail shoe, but dang, I am sold. Traction is actually on point. I tried to slide my foot back on the carpet in my office and it was going to pull the carpet up before letting me slip. It's got that modern/old school vibe to it, like the Dodge Challenger of shoes. Little to no manufactures defects (glue spillage, stringies, mis-stich,...). Fit was pretty great straight out of the box, wore for 3 hr. with no break in and entire foot and ankle felt fine after.": "5", "Gave bad blisters. Couldn't even hike for 20 minutes in the shoes. Ended up taking them off and hiking the trail barefoot.": "1", "Excellent quality and unmatched comfort. Overall excellent shoe.": "5", "Very comfortable and flexible for playing disc golf. Love that they are waterproof without being stiff": "5", "The desgin look amazing and the shoe is very comfortable.": "5", "The shoe is very average, it didn't fit me well and wasn't very comfortable. The price isn't too bad but the shoe is very average.": "3", "I love this shoes very comfortable and light. Perfect for walking": "5", "These shoes are comfortable and fit very well. I have narrow feet but the width is still acceptable. These are light and feel great on the feet.": "5", "The shoes are amazing and never before got something like that": "5", "I really liked the color and comfort of the product. I recommend this product to everyone.": "5", "Need to return too small.  Need to return too small.Need to return too small.": "3", "I've owned several pairs of Terrex Agravic since I started running outdoors. They hold up and give more than the usual support for the terrain. This latest model is more of what I've done to expect from them.": "5", "Great traction and sturdy but still flexible and breathable on foot for hot days on the trail": "5", "If you're looking for running in snow, ice and slush then get this shoe !": "4", "Another winner for Adidas,Great shoe and beautiful design": "5", "As expected from Adidas the quality is very good! The shoes are comfortable, I bought them for work and feel great in them all day long!": "5", "Well build for the trail. You give up a little bit of comfort because of the rugged materials use but once broken in they will be your go to off road trail shoe": "5", "Comfortable and lightweight for a trail running shoe.": "5", "Great shoes for trails. I needed some dedicated trail shoes and these did not disappoint. Very comfortable and nice tread on the soles for uneven trails.": "5", "Great comfort, awesome support,  lightweigh, have received lots of compliments on style and color combination.": "5", "I bought these for work and let me tell you they are the best work shoe I have ever bought. They feel just as good on my feet at 5pm as they did at 5 am when I first put them on. Do your feet a favor and buy these your feet will thank you": "5", "Stick to the trail shoes if you're a heavy runner and they last longer than the lighter shoes.": "5", "I bought 2 pairs of adidas, after a week of using them one of the Addis's pairs broke completely.I have been a costumer if adidas for years and this is the first time I had such a bad quality shoes": "1", "I have always been a fan of the trail running shoe. This one tops them all. It has a cool design, incorporating some great colors and not compromising comfort. A great purchase indeed.": "4", "For off trail running, the shoe does not have the necessary absorption or cushion beneath my feet I'd have expected from Adidas.": "3", "My feet are fairly narrow, and these fit nice and snug, no sloshing around while on the trail.": "5", "A great, rugged shoe for the outdoors. Appears this shoe is going to hold up well and has great traction.": "5", "Really love these shoes for hiking, as they have good traction to not slip when going up inclines, but also not trip on roots, branches, etc. I will say you should definitely NOT wear ankle/no-show socks with them, the back of my foot got a little torn up from the first go with ankle socks.": "5", "I really like this shoe, and I wished it didn't chaff the back of my left ankle. I tried adjusting the laces, but, right now, the chaffing bothers me the most. I'm hoping that with time the shoe would feel better. Therefore, it's a really great shoe, and I would say expect some chaffing from this shoe at first.": "4", "These running shoes are so comfortable , you should definitely buy these.": "4", "the shoes are perfect for trail and even street running, they are comfortable and have great traction.": "5", "Only issue I had was the stitching came undone on the bend of my shoe so I stitched it with braided fishing line. Lol": "4", "Not enough arch support. Other than that its an okay Trail shoe. I wouldn't recommend for Trail Running.": "3", "I really like this shoe.Excelent quality for training in trail.Size was perfect .Good overall training shoe.Excellent quality.The weight is reasonable for the category.The midsole give good support and response.Very satisfied with the Terrex Agavic TR.": "5", "Very comfortable. Very supportive shoes. But after filling out this review, and having to go back TWICE, to finish. Because my review was not long enough. I will never fill out another survey again.": "5", "These shoes are great for walking in the trails when I go hiking and they are pretty water resistant too": "5", "Good grip and built like working boots but with the comfort.": "5", "Good pair used for my MTB on the trails as spare pair": "5", "Bought these for mowing. They work much better for mowing than my old recycled Boosts. Grippy and more support.": "5", "stylish and comfy shoe and great for going on a long walk": "5", "Perfect low top sneaker great for running and movements on rough terrain.": "5", "If I could have tried them on first I probably would have gotten a different size. Other than that they are what I expected.": "4", "Shoes have a unique sharp styling! Quality construction and comfortable fit!": "5", "The shoes I purchased are a great fit and style. I hike regularly and the the hold up well.": "5", "I install flooring for a living and go through a pair of shoes every month to month in a half. These so far show no sign of breakage. My feet feel protected but yet stay nice and cool all day.": "4", "The sole of my 13 year old Adidas trail runners separated recently, so I ordered these for a replacement.  I read reviews and ordered size 11 (I wear 10 1/2 in all my other Adidas) and they fit perfectly.  Tread is solid and grippy on the trail.  I have a back injury that causes pain in my foot, as well as a foot injury to boot, and my feet did not hurt at all after a two hour hike.  Very satisfied and highly recommend.": "5", "Great sole traction. Bought them for disc golf and they are great!": "5", "Feels good after 10 minutes of wear but feels even better to take them off. Look pretty  smell nice": "4", "This is my second pair of ax3's.  Great shoes for disc golf": "5", "I wanted something with more support and better wear than my last pair of Adidas.These have plenty of leather to provide support. The soles are quite hard and are actually a little noisy on hard surfaces. Definitely not a running shoe but I think it will make a good trail shoe.Size was what I always order. They were tight in the toe at first but after 10 miles or so they are feeling pretty good. I think they still could use a wider toe.": "4", "Shoe is like walking with a 2x4 on your foot. There is no give or flex.": "2", "I really wanted to like these shoes. I need a 13W but none was offered so I tried the 13. The toe box was too narrow, so that was a deal killer. However, regardless of the toe box issue, the heel box was waaaay to big. My heels almost popped out with every step. I saw the heel box issue on other comments. Trust me, it is true!": "2", "Shoe is made of durable material. Perfect for hiking or wearing around work": "5", "I was worry fro the reviews that it might be narrow fitting.  I don't have wide fit but some shoes feel very tight.  These were a perfect fit and became perfectly comfortable after I added arch support. I can walk/hike for a long time without any discomfort in my feet.": "5", "Comfortable outdoor shoes with a wonderful fit.Great grip on multiple surfaces.Priced perfectly for what you get.!": "5", "Use for disc golf (dry weather), continental is amazing grip! And I can trust the shoes. High traction when hiking up hill, or in thick grass, as well as in dry dirt, giving me the traction needed to put full effort into my throws!": "5", "Shoes seem hard with very little cushion.  They look great.": "3", "Everything is great about the shoe except the sole, it's bullet proof(which some might not consider a bad thing). When walking on any surface it sounds like tap shoes, the is no give to this sole. Might be great on a rocky, hard trail but wearing around town it is not ideal.": "3", "Right in line with every other Adidas shoe I've bought.  Great looking and high performance.": "5", "I bought a half size smaller than I would in the other leading brand and they fit perfectly.": "4", "They are a little to stiff. But overall a pretty good show to wear on any hiking trip!": "5", "After reading some of the reviews advising to buy a half size bigger, I found out personally that wasn't the case. I've always been told you wanting hiking books snug and if you buy them a half size too big  they won't be. Buy your regular size and you'll be fine. I bought mine a half size too big and there's too much play.": "5", "First Adidas after high school should order 1/2 or 1 size larger.": "3", "Size 14 too short.  My big toe hit the end of the shoe.": "3", "I took a chance on these shoes after I had bought another pair of Adidas somewhere else. And I have to say I love them. I will be getting another pair soon. Loved them in high school love them as an adult.": "5", "Adidas do not surprise when we talk about comfort, it's my favorite brand and when i it's too good I'm being redundant": "5", "Perfect for any occasion from office to outdoor. Very comfortable.": "5", "Great support, nice and roomy. I wear a 7.5 and a 7 would have been better, even with thick sock.": "4", "the sizing are inconsistent among adidas product. have to increase 1 size for fitting": "5", "I bought same with same size before, they were perfect, but they one no:(What I bought now, is a big bigger, maybe 1/5 size more and they are not comfortable": "2", "True to size from adidas sizing chart. The traction is exallent and are very comfortable. It took a couple of days wearing them at the office and around the house before they were comfortable enough to wear on the trails. They feel really great now.": "4", "They fit true to size and perfect for long walks or hikes": "5", "I'm very satisfied overall with looks a d color and comfort. I would probably buy another pair down the road. 10 years ago Addidas made a running shoe that was lightweight and super comfortable.  The mess on top of the shoe was see through and you can see your socks. I l bought 2 pair. I loved them, they let your feet breath and the colors were navy blue and black. If you were to bring back these shoes I would buy them.": "4", "They feel good ,and the shipping was on pointThe shipping department kept me in the loop.": "5", "These are just what I was looking for! I was concerned with usually needing to buy wide shoes with wide flat feet but I took a chance on regular width since that's all they have- and they fit just right. It's comfortably snug but not tight. I also measured for the correct size using their guide- I debated going half a size but just figured I would go with what I measured and it was the right choice. I usually add my own inserts for better arch support but I technically don't need to with these as they're super comfortable and I haven't had any issues after wearing as is for a couple weeks. The water resistant quality is also really good as I've worn there in the rain and some minor puddles. Very happy with purchase and will definitely buy this model again- I also found the price to be very reasonable. Highly recommend!": "5", "I know it's a terrain shoe but it's super comfortable and I wear them for just about anything.": "5", "I usually wear size 10 with adidas but based on other reviews decided to go with 10.5 for these and the recommendation was spot on! Definitely would recommend and purchase again!": "5", "These are totally workable hiking shoes for the price. They grip slippery ground well and are reasonably comfortable. Obviously, there's no boost and I imagine some of the fancier models are better, but this is solid if you're just starting out.": "4", "Probably some of the best quality shoes I've own, I got these for work as I do warehouse style, they're comfy, durable and I don't gotta worry about get my foot crushed or wet": "5", "Feeling so comfortable to wear it while play disc golf!": "5", "These hikers are awesome! They fit well, look really good and are comfortable. Glow in the dark stripes for extra protection while out walking at night. I will buy again in a different color.": "5", "Once I found the size online only, they fitted perfect and love the style.": "5", "Great shoe in general but fantastic for hiking and walking on rough terrain!": "5", "I ordered my size and really live the look and the quality. That said, these were the most uncomfortable shoes ever. Maybe I should have sized up. Too late though. I wore them and they make my feet hurt. Still great quality and look. Just painful.": "2", "The shoe exceeded my expectations.  I have over 30 pairs of shoes and wear them all. These shoes will go on my favorites rack.": "5", "The top eyelet where the lace pulls thru has already come apart in two pieces; on only the third day of use. The shoe is narrow however it is rugged construction and they were recently purchased; so for me it probably just needs some break in time.": "3", "I like the colors it was very soft when I first put it on": "5", "QUALITY APPEARS TO BE VERY GOOD.  LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMFORTABLE.": "5", "They aight. A little uncomfortable and track everything inside": "5", "I really like the look of these hiking shoes. When I first got them I found them pretty stiff and not nearly as comfortable as some other adidas. As I continued to wear them the comfort got a bit better. Still not as great as my Boost running shoes, but given that they are for hiking, it's sort of what I expected. I do wish the insole was a bit thicker. PS: Weather has prevented me from getting a hike in, so still need to see how they perform in that context.": "4", "Purchased this shoe for hiking. From the very first day had no problems with it. Fits perfect, has a good grip and Love this shoes.": "5", "If the sole was stiffer and 1/4 thicker, the shoe would be awesome.": "3", "Adidas never let's me down. All their shoes seem to fit me the same. I have a high arch and wide toes and Adidas is my go to. These hiking shoes are great. The only thing I would change is the lace color. I changed mine to all black. Traction and comfort are spot on.": "5", "Excellent arch support. Feels comfortable, color style is nice looking also.": "5", "I was looking forward to testing out this hiking shoes. It has been my first pair of hiking shoes. I took them in a eight mile hike. Halfway through the hike the shoes were already coming undone. The sole is not very good. You can feel the rocky surfaces in your feet. Like the sole doesn't provide enough cushion.": "2", "Great for standing and walking for long periods at a time": "5", "My boyfriend LOVES these shoes. As soon as he gets home he kicks off the steel toed shoes from work and slips these on.Originally, I got them for when we hike and fish but they turned into his everyday pair of shoes.Cant wait for mine to arrive!": "5", "My 2nd pair love them for work in the summer . I work on cement  floors.": "5", "These are incredibly narrow and look ridiculous when wearing pants. They also run way big. Order at least a half size smaller than usual.": "1", "Size is right. Hard bottom for the streets but comfortable for your feet.": "4", "Very comfortable once broken in. Initially would bend over metatarsal heads causing pain. After wearing on short walks and on errands I was able to hiKe comfortably. Love the tread.": "5", "Well built super durable,very comfortable. Bought my second pair before the first pair was broken in .": "5", "I purchased these for my son for ChristmasHe LOVES them": "5", "I bought these for work and so far they are great.  Really like them.  Stylish supportive and comfortable.": "5", "ideal for dirt hiking, super strong construction. very nice materials.i dont like to use insoles. i like a good firm shoe. this is an excellent fit.": "5", "Totally like them , fit great and are very comfortable.  Totally recommend them": "5", "The shoes are ok, I figured I give it a try to break them in but it was painful because they run about 1/2 size too small": "3", "Great traction on sandy/rocky trails. Shoes are narrow but good for my feet.": "5", "very comfortable, good quality cold weather shoe, gives good support and easily wipes clean": "5", "Bought these for my husband for walking and light hiking, this is his second pair. He finds them very comfortable. He replaced the insole with a more supportive one. His only complaint is that the treads wore out fairly quickly.": "5", "I play Disc Golf pretty much daily. These shoes fit perfectly, are extremely comfortable, and are resistant to wear and tear no matter what I've put them through so far. I can't recommend them enough.": "5", "I hike trails with serous elevations. The bumpers on the toes are great on rocky trails. Great support on 3+ hour hikes!": "5", "They look good but not at all like the the ankle high trac that were sold out.  Hard heel feels less comfortable.  Needs to include the shoe string method on the Trac as well.": "2", "Great shoes.  Not hard to break in. My son is very particular about breaking in his shoes so I was pleased that these were so easy.": "5", "Good quality and water resistance make it a good choice for every activity": "5", "This shoe really impressed me. I was in the market for a new trail shoe and this one was well priced and looked amazing. The boot style sole is perfect for hikes along the rocky Appalachian Mountains in PA. They needed to be worn-in as the sole is a bit stiff on the first wear but after that they became extremely comfortable. The fit was perfect as well and they seem to be very sturdy. Definitely happy with this purchase.": "5", "Bought a second pair as I liked them so much , waiting for other colors in my size to become available": "5", "2nd pair I've had of these, this time with the Gore-Tex. Great all around shoes, and the waterproof is a plus feature. Will say they run a bit narrow, so needed to break in a bit. And they could have longer laces in my opinion. But even with those 2 points, they still get a 5 star!": "5", "Love the style of this shoe. My husband loved his Christmas gift": "5", "The shoes fit perfectly and feel great!! I would definitely recommend and would purchase more shoes.": "5", "I would love to give a review, but my shows never showed up and Adidas insulted me with a 30% coupon as a consolation.": "1", "This is a decent shoe.  Seems fairly durable.  A bit hard when walking or running.  More of a hiker than a trail runner.": "3", "personally, these look good and feel ok until you walk a while in them. the cushioning is just not enough. They're popular for disc golf but i cant wear them anymore, too hard on my feet": "3", "These shoes are the perfect fit on and off the disc golf course. They hold up to most terrain and are stylish after the round is over.": "5", "These are good for being on roofs all day. Never really slip too much": "5", "These shoes are super dope and fresh! I could wear these all day. Start with a morning walk, casual wear throughout the day, throw in an afternoon jog and cap the day off with an all night underground rave inspired by hard, heavy bass beats! I'll be sick, dope and fresh all day, everyday when sporting my new Adidas kicks!!!!": "5", "I love these hiking shoes. The are very comfortable over a lengthy hike, even on its first hike without a break-in period.The only thing about this shoe is the narrow insole, where my custom insole won't fit. This might be a deal breaker for most, but I found the shoe to have decent arch support. I might look for other insoles to fit.": "5", "Can't wait to see how they hold up when I disc golf!": "5", "If you wear wide, you don't want this product. It is too narrow.": "1", "These hiking shoes made sure I stuck to the ground with no slippage and great traction. The only knock on them is that you will need to add something for better foot comfort as the insole wasn't that great. Still a great show and can be better with that simple improvement.": "5", "Bought them for my son, he really liked them for disc golf.": "4", "Got these shoes specifically for disc golf and immediately put them to use on a cold, mucky course. Feet stayed warm and dry": "5", "Well built, nicely designed, and comfortable to wear. Looking forward to some adventures in these shoes!": "5", "Got these for disc golf.

Thank you adidas for making an exceptional shoe.": "5", "The size is smaller than running version I had to exchange for a size bigger": "5", "I use these to primarily play disc golf and they're the best feeling and most durable around! The tee pads are usually concrete and the Continental soles grip like the road! There's also a lot of different terrain and they perform as advertised!!": "5", "These are the best hiking shoes to date. I own multiple Terrex shoes and these are the go-to shoes for all day rugged hikes. Very highly recommended!": "5", "These were bought for my son to play disc golf.

Highly recommend and will buy again": "4", "These shoes are very comfortable right out of the box would highly recommend for anybody who does a decent amount of walking.": "5", "Like the looks feels good would like it more if it was all black with the green highlights.The bottom is solid . I hope the I side breaks in after wearing them": "4", "Second pair of these - first pair lasted 3 years + of almost daily wear, great value!": "5", "I love the AX2 unfortunately they don't make them no more for adults.  I got the gore-tex AX3 only problem was at mid foot Bridge was tight.  That could be just my foot not adidas problem.  Returned with no problem and got me the Terrex AX3 which is exactly what I needed same as AX2 very comfortable.": "5", "Good quality show, shipped really fast. They are a bit small though, order a size big.": "4", "I tried a number of brands and models and this one works best. It is low profile, which I prefer. It is water proof which works great here in N. California, against the damp and cold. It looks great and low key. Simply best bang for the buck. Bought another pair with different color for rotation.": "5", "I use them to hike, fish, work, and any other random activities I can come up with. The construction and form of the shoe is perfect. I am buying the gortex lined swift 2 next since its snowing in Colorado.": "5", "I bought them for work. They are really good looking and comfortable.": "5", "Good product as always always alwaysalways always always": "5", "Once you adjust the tongue and shoelaces, this becomes one of the most comfortable work shoes ever. They are super durable, they do not get dirty easily, and I can wear them all day. These are great shoes for walking and hiking.": "5", "Good price, I do a lot of walking I think there very comfortable": "5", "The shoe has great traction and it is very comfortable to wear.": "5", "These shoes are so comfortable for everyday at work when I'm running around!": "5", "They were to small and though they would be more black": "3", "The terrex is a wonderful shoe, great stability, comfortable, grippy, and best of all jet black!

Comfortable, fit great, and have excellent traction. Hopefully they last!": "5", "This shoe is so rugged, apt, and up to the job!  It's hard to believe you can have comfort and sill be able to wear such a rugged shoe all day!": "5", "These shoes are very flexible and comfortable. The wide fit is perfect for uphill walks. I have walked in these shoes in the rain and haven't gotten my feet wet.": "5", "Broke in these shoes in one shift at work. They stay pretty clean and are comfortable.": "5", "I really like this shoes. It fells really soft and confortable inside the shoe. And when being outside at the mountain it\u00b4s really smooth": "5", "Great fit. Real tough and durable. Bought them as a work shoe and they are great all around!": "5", "Great design,excellent card lreay, be y comfortable": "4", "Would buy it again! Need these type of shoes for my work.": "5", "Overall I found the Terrex AX3 hiking shoe to fit well and comfortable. The only issue is with the Continental bottom The material is very hard and provides no cushioning when walking. Maybe the lugs will provide good grip on snow and last longer through the winter.": "4", "I like the TERREX AX3. It is a well built and comfortable shoe. If I had one wish it would be for it to have a slightly bigger toe box. My  big toes point up slightly and I have a hard time with most shoes that companies are making now. I have some adidas tennis shoes that are perfect. I just wish the AX3's were the same. But for most people, these shoes are a good buy.": "4", "Purchased this 2nd pair and they fit great! Perfect for our long walks!": "5", "A little snug on the toes and loose on the heels. Rubber looked like it would separate with just a little wear": "2", "Great for disc golf! Barely shows my toe drag and extremely durable.": "5", "You can definitely feel the shoe gripping to terrain . I'm so used to using running shoes and sliding.": "5", "This is my fourth or fifth pair. I wear them for work everyday and I love them.": "5", "spouse has flat feet and complains with many shoes. no complaints, feels great support.": "5", "Feels very supportive. And has great grip for many different trails. Have used on solid rock, loose gravel sandy trails very impressive. Would have expected to pay much more for this type of trail shoe. Haven't had them long enough to talk about life of the shoe but looks and feels like they are with me long term. Tested them in a small  Georgia water fall, shallow water and grip was very good.": "5", "Not very comfortable   Very bulky. Not lightweight": "2", "Used it for walking five times a week, about 4-5 km. Very comfortable.After one month wear, it started to torn. Very disappointed.": "1", "Wore shoes in national parks in Utah and they didn't disappoint. Gripped to rocks very well and were comfortable the entire time while hiking for a couple of days and a total of around 15 miles": "5", "I like the shoe and it seems to have good traction.  I have started hiking more  often and find that it is quite comfortable and slip resistant.": "5", "good support.  Little hard in the midsole.  Seems to be a good for the price and function.": "4", "My new shoes a sturdy and have ample traction for hiking or running on grass. I love the style and the fit. They fit securely and comfortably. I can tell these shoes are constructed with care and quality materials.": "5", "I really liked the styling on these shoes, so I reached out to a representative of the company via text regarding the width as I have quite wide feet EEE-EEEE.  The rep said the shoes were wide.  Well, when received these shoes ARE NOT wide at all.  I couldn't even put the show on my right foot.  So, great looking shoe, but do not buy if you have wide feet as these will not fit or will be uncomfortable.": "4", "awesome shoes for everyday wear as well as hiking.": "5", "Got these for my dad, he likes gore-tex hiking shoes, but he needs some breathability, I told him that terrex shoes fit wider feet better than some other brands, he likes 'em.": "4", "These shoes really compliment the season colors. Not only they are comfortable, they are sturdy and look great!!": "5", "Loved these. great for hiking or just having a nice strong supportive shoe.": "5", "I've got the boring get version, I've used this for work, hiking trails, and this might be the only adidas that I can wear all day. The soles are nice n thick, cushions, supports, and protect your feel like they're supposed to.It's also very breathable, so you can do high intensity activities without turning your shoes into a sauna! If you like the style get it, did you take these pair almost anywhere.": "5", "First Adidas for me, started with the rightpair.": "5", "I bought this pair of shoes for mountain hiking. This pair of shoes fit me very well and I like the color and style that can match my different outfits.": "5", "I read the reviews and was looking for a stylish, comfortable shoe that I could wear with my plantar fasciitis.  Unfortunately, this shoe was beyond uncomfortable for me.  The toe box is definitely too narrow.": "2", "excelent product fit really good and confortable and nice style": "5", "Nice quality hiking shoes for the price,  very comfortable and durable.": "5", "The Terrex AX models are excellent hikers compared to others in their price range. The heel counter is solid, the mesh upper is breathable and robust, and the outsole maintains traction in a variety of conditions. Unfortunately, Adidas has compromised a well-made shoe with a poor insole. The molded insole is removable but is stiff and lacks adequate arch support. After replacing the insole with a softer one from a competitor, the Terrex AX has become a favorite.": "3", "Bought a similar pair of black Adidas a few years back. I should have purchased 2 pair, I love them so much. I spent the last year looking for a future replacement for my originals. Although the originals are still in great shape, I'm really happy I found the Terrex AX3. Great fit, look, and comfort. The ladies like having a universal \"little black dress.\" Similarly, I like having a pair of \"black Adidas sneakers\" as a universal shoe.": "5", "Comfortable pair of shoes like the quality will use site again": "5", "The most comfortable/capable shoe I've ever owned.": "5", "These were a gift for my bf who works at a restaurant, he loved them says they're very comfortable!": "5", "Good shoe for hiking so far especially for the price point.": "4", "What a beautiful shoe. The color scheme is crazy. Fits and feels great.": "5", "Great shoe! Quality material and comfort! Slightly narrow on up near the toe for me but other wise perfect fit.": "5", "Not terrible shoes. Took them out on one 5 mile hike and the gusseted tongue really cuts into the top of my foot. Definitely were not advantageous over the cheap pair of boots I was not using. Also the toe scuffs super easy, so don't count on keeping these nice. Definitely not a real hiking shoe.": "3", "The fit is perfect. My only real qualms with this shoe are that they could definitely be more comfortable and that they make my foot look awfully wide, making my 10.5 foot size look clownish.": "4", "Great shoe, excellent quality, easy to break in and comfortable from day one, great hiking shoes": "5", "Love look of shoe. Unfortunately shoe design is way too narrow for my feet and there is not a wide fit available for that style. Returning shoes.": "2", "Great fit, style, traction. Would recommend to others.": "5", "True to size and very comfortable even more once broken in, durable and light perfect for all day adventures.": "5", "nice shoes, great sole,  excellent traction. Great purchase.": "5", "Nice shoe, it seems to run a bit narrow so nice time I'll order a half to full size up. Otherwise it's a really good shoe": "4", "They fit true to size in my experience I have many pair of terrex shoes and these don't disappoint and little on the bulky side in my opinion but overall a awesome shoe": "5", "Love the style of my shoes, will more than likely get one more pair": "5", "Very comfortable,I can walk all day.I have 3 pairs of this now.": "5", "Excellent walking shoes for a person like me who walks a least two hours per day..": "5", "My husband loves this shoes his favorite I've bein purchasing this product for ever.": "5", "I like these shoes. They're nice seemingly durable as well": "4", "So comfortable. Great traction on all types of surfaces.": "5", "I was looking for a shoe that would stand up to the rigors of walking on a trail or hiking through the neighborhood but also looked choice on my feet. This shoe met all of those and then some": "5", "These shoes were great at first, but don't use them for outdoor purposes. They don't withstand outdoor hiking and walking.": "3", "Used these on very slippery rock, bushwhacking and in water walking for ten miles and they didn't miss a beat. I was kind of nervous as this trail had severe terrain with potentially damaging/fatal cliffs/hills/descents and these shoes proved worthy. Didn't carry much water weight in the seven miles of walking in water, dried quickly with smart wool socks on. A++": "5", "These shoes are comfortable and stylish. They fit great.": "5", "Bought these for my Bf and he loves them! Would definitely buy these again!": "5", "Very great shoes and I love them would like to buy some more very soon and I going get so.e for my brother": "5", "I like the look of the sneakers.   I wore them one day to work.   I wasn't prepared for the hardness of the soles.   I mostly sit and after 8 hours my feet were killing me.  I gave them another try but it was the sneakers.   Make sure you bring other comfortable shoes when you wear these.   I really wanted them to be comfortable because they look nice.": "2", "Great for light hikes and or trail runs! Fits perfectly": "5", "Favorite shoes for work, have 2 pairs and love them.": "5", "Amazing view, my favorite color. They are fit to 3 seasons!": "5", "The shoes Looks great and they feels great. I also like the bottom of the shoes great traction.": "5", "Pretty good for the price, but nothing special. Wish they were waterproof and they fit a bit wide": "4", "Super comfortable from the time I first put them on. No \"break in\" time needed. Gripped perfectly on steep dirt. Rugged and good looking. Will get another colorway!": "5", "Bought these after getting similar Terrex for my son. We both really like these shoes.": "5", "Great look, quality, comfort, value, but runs too small": "5", "Too bad the toe box runs a little too narrow not an all day shoe": "2", "I wanted to like these shoes, but unfortunately the fit and way they are constructed caused problems for me. The fit is on a tight size in the front/toe box, and the wider in the heel area. another problem is that the shoe is cut low around the ankle, which leads to instability and my foot slipping out of the shoe. Had to return these. I hope that Adidas is able to make great trail shoes as they used to, with a more natural/logical fit.": "1", "Great durable, slip resistant, sporty look and fit, ready for anything": "5", "The shoes are good but they are not waterproof/water ressistant. Your socks will get soaking wet if it wet terain.": "2", "Living in Phoenix, I do a lot of trail running and hiking.  I have several different types of hiking boots and trail runners.  This is the first pair of Adidas I have purchased for trail running.  I can say that after 2  trail runner, these are my favorites in comfort and stability.": "5", "Because yuh don't slip that easy I like how they look with different clothes": "5", "I have very flat feet and the Adidas AX series are the best! I could go on all day but in short, they are very durable, look great, have great stability and support. I can walk around all day with no pain or soreness. I just hope they don't change! I've had 4 pairs in the last 3-4 years and the only thing I'm requesting is more color options.": "5", "Great looking shoe, but just not comfortable. No flax or no give. Been wearing them around the house for two weeks to see if they break in a little. Not giving up yet!": "2", "I like a hiking stiff shoe for my everyday work wear and find the Adidas Terrex AX3 to be my ideal go to. I also like the durability and traction when on short day hikes. I currently have this shoe in three different colors, so I am always coordinated in my daily comfort.": "5", "Great sneakers and for the price you can't go wrong very happy with the price": "5", "Great comfort and durability. The came at the right time.": "5", "Very uncomfortable even with the right size. Unlike my other Adidas shoes": "2", "These were uncomfortable from the start, but I kept them thinking they needed breaking in.  They look great so I took a chance and kept them to wear.  They did break in somewhat; however, the soles are so hard they're very uncomfortable to wear for a full day.  There's almost no padding under the pad of your foot, so it transmits every little pebble you step on.  I don't know if I got a bad pair because looking at other reviews people were raving about all say comfort right out of the box.  I would say if you buy these and they're not comfortable right out of the box, send them back.  It won't get better.": "1", "Shoe looks great and is made specifically with a purpose. Fit is comfortable. For me I normally wear a 10.5 but in these I ordered 10 because I've noticed on most of my Terrex Hikers the foot area runs wide and my foot is skinny. On this shoe the fit around ankle is snug which is great for me. The shoe box area is wide but because I ordered a size down its perfect.": "5", "The quality is pretty good. I love the sock around the ankle for more freedom.": "4", "This was my second shoe that has Boost and after getting my Ultraboost 20's I knew that any hiking shoe had to have it. I think the boost here may be even more impact absorbing than even the UB20's, this is seriously one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. I love that the boost is black, since that won't stain as easily as white, so it's a great color for hiking and the Goretex waterproofing is very welcome. I had heard these run a half-size too big but I found that going True-To-Size was perfect and the footprint seemed the same as my UB20. Something else I appreciated is that the back of the shoe really does support your heel and keep your feet straight, which is important for unsure terrain. The pulltab on the back is extremely hepful and something I'd like to see the Ultraboosts adopt as well.I hope Adidas continues this line, it's a truly excellent hiking shoe that fills a void that Hiking products suffer from in general.": "5", "Very comfortable and agile when going through tough terrain. Jumped through puddles of water and walked through snow and not one bit of my socks or feet got wet.": "5", "So i have to start by sayin my expectations have been exceeded 1000%. I'm not really someone who hikes , especially not in the woods, i bought these simply because i wear techwear style clothing and these fit into my aesthetic very well. With all that said, i expected these to be a super hard and tight fitting hiking boot , but i couldn't have been more wrong. Adidas  basically proved that you can create a boot that is both soft and comfortable but also durable. I've been wearing them like crazy the Gore-Tex is amazing and my feet stay dry. I sized up automatically because i thought they would fit tight and it does seem that it was the best move because they fit perfectly and provided extra comfort, so if you're more so wearing this for lifestyle sizing up is a good idea.": "5", "These did what they're supposed to do. Kept my feet  dry and was warm enough last winter with the comfort provided by the ultraboost. Traction is pretty awesome as well. It's is pretty tight though, so going half a size is a must.": "5", "i got these cause i do a lot of cityscape and landscape photography and i find my self hiking a lot just to get good views. these are perfect as i get that water proof and the ultra boost sole.": "5", "Don't listen to anyone these are amazing for work, play, and of course if you really hike. Keep in mind these are a boot. They are sleek, but still a boot. Runs true to size but you can squeeze a half size smaller if you want to avoid clunkiness. 9/10 Pleased with purchase. -Lloyd": "5", "This boot is offers everything you need in a hiking boot. The construction is quality starting with the stitching, excellent tread, flexible materials that protect you from the elements while keeping your feet comfortable.": "5", "Best shoes I own. The comfort level of these shoes is outstanding. They are very water resistant keeping my feet dry on rainy days. The traction keeps me from slipping on any surface. Hands down best shoes ever.": "5", "Comfortable for long period of timeGreat for hiking": "5", "No break in time.  Cushion is awesome.  Very comfortable. Well worth the money.": "5", "Love that they are waterproof I train at the beach and hike in these boots daily can't wait to get another pair.": "5", "I awaited a product like this for a long time.   Finally got ride of my winter boots. With the gortex and boost  technology. This sneaker is hard to beat. Adidas for life!": "5", "I reach for these every time I go outside. The comfort coupled with the stability and waterproofing make it a great all-around sneaker. Not just for the mountains but the city as well!": "5", "Pleasant for walking down the street through the elements or handling rougher terrain": "4", "Perfect for style and sport. Love that the shoe is lightweight, comfortable and doesn't feel or look clunky. Also love the sizing. I normally wear a 15 and have a wide and flat foot but got this a whole size down in a 14 and it fits perfectly. Great addition to anyone's repertoire whether it's for sport or fashion!": "5", "Husband says, it's so comfortable that it made him want to keep hiking.": "5", "First: I LOVE THESE SHOES! SECOND: They are way overpriced. I've had these shoes for roughly three weeks, and tread is ALMOST gone. In the shoes defense, I work for UPS and walk about 11 miles a day, step count is about 24k/ day. For my job, these are great!! But, they just don't last long enough for me. They are super comfortable, my feet don't feel tired, great ankle protection, antislip, and they definitely protected my toes from accidents.": "4", "Ive spent alot of money on shoes. I always take care of my feet.  These by far are the best all around hiking shoe i've found for the $.  The only thing that could make me happier is if we could choose custom color schemes.": "5", "I'm love it  very comfortable. I can walk with this all day long": "5", "The gortex comes in real handy for the rain and the slick all black color way is amazing.": "5", "This product exceeded my expectations. Comfortable for a long day and keeps the foot dry in wet conditions.": "5", "I'm a first responder and these are on the right path for being the most comfortable and best shoe for the service. I has hoping that adidas would put a boost sole on a work/hike boot. If there was an option for side zip I think it would be perfect. I need to be able to get my foot wear on as fast as possible and the ankle collar is a bit tight. Haven't had a lot of chances to test the gore-tex water resistance, but so far my feet are dry.": "4", "They are super comfortable and I would buy them again in a different color if they had my size": "5", "The quality is good the goretex design gives the shoes a good to wear every day rain or snow  the  sock like material Makes it even more comfortable to walk around with only down is when putting on the shoes is a lil uncomfortable due to the small  space on the sock  but over all I will recommend these product": "5", "I would recommend this shoe to anyone and everyone.": "5", "Waterproof, comfortable, form fitting. Slightly wide, which is usually the case with Gore-Tex sneakers styles. Room for thick socks.": "4", "GREAT HIKING BOOT SO FAR. I WEAR THEM EVERYDAY AND NO COMPLAINTS.": "5", "I'd buy these in all colors!They're great!I wear these instead of boots!The addition of gore-tex makes these a winner!": "5", "These shoes are very comfortable but not durable, at all. The soles wore out and the fabric over the toes ripped after just six months of light use (daily walking).": "2", "I have multiple pairs of freehikers and the gortex is the best keeping you dry!": "5", "The Terrex Free Hiker is the perfect mix of style and function. The shoes look awesome in person. That they have a GTX upper and boost lower really is the cherry on top.": "5", "If you are familiar with both the Terex and the Ultraboost shoes, what might question what size to pick, in short pick the size you buy a Ultraboost shoe. So size up a 1/2 measurement. I took a gamble and went with my size in the Terex line, and it was a mistake l. I returned them and had a proper size shipped back within a week of dropping the original order off at FedEx. These shoes are a great middle ground between the Ultraboost and Terex lines, just remember they run narrow.": "5", "Pricey shoe. I went a 1/2 size larger than other Boost runners. Happy I did that as they are 1. Tight to get on and 2. I wear thicker socks in the winter. The shoes are unbelievably comfortable. Love them. New favorites.": "5", "They are marvelously comfortable once I get them on. But the elastic at the top is so tight that it is a real struggle to get my foot into them, even with the help of the strap at the back and a long shoe horn.": "5", "My husband love these boots. He already has a pair of ultra boost but he said these are just as comfortable!": "5", "One of the best boots. and can wear inside since when the top is cover looks like  a pair of sneakers.": "5", "They are amazing, comfortable and they are exactly what the description says": "5", "So far so good. I was researching for a lightweight trekking,  hiking pair of shoes after trying a bunch of them feeling quite heavy on the legs. I have been using Adidas sneakers for a long time and was always impressed with the weight and durability. These feel almost like that. Super lightweight and stable, excellent cushioning and high enough not to worry about water splashes etc. Also I am always between sizes between 10 and 10.5 and the 10.5 was the right choice. Definitely a tight fit I guess because of the elastic upper portion but nothing unbearable.  I will be looking to get another pair again or try some other options from Adidas. But these are definitely on the top of my list right now.": "5", "I'm a dog walker so I'm on my feet a lot. Living in Michigan the winter is brutal. These keep my feet warm, dry and comfortable. The fit was perfect.": "5", "Most expensive shoes I've ever bought but wow they sure are worth it. I ended up buying an 8.5 (same size I always buy in Adidas) they are slightly big but its not too big of an issue. I use these shoes for hiking/walking/ delivery job. Most comfy shoes!!! You never have to break them. Works great in rain and snow. I will buy again possibly sizer 8 next time.": "5", "Great shoe! I already bought a second pair for my son.": "5", "They are snug in a good way and keep my feet warm and dry for winter weather. They have good grip as well.": "5", "Well my husband is FedEx express & I purchased these shoes on Jan.19, it is currently Feb.5 & already having issues with the front sole of the shoe. So we do wish to speak to costumer service to see how we can resolve this issue because I payed a good amount for these pricey shoes for them to have issues already.": "2", "Love these so much that I wanted another pair bec I wore out my first pair. Great everyday comfort of a sneaker but in a hiking boot trim. Great support ant comfort.": "5", "I wish I had picked up a 1/2 size smaller than I bought.": "4", "man oh man where do i start? I have a few ultraboost and bought these for work when it rains because sometimes i work outside and i hate getting my shoes soaked and decided to purchase these even tho they are on the pricey side , just got them today and man i think their more comfortable then the regular ultra boost , they do have a little more boost on the bottom compared to the other ones and they snug ur feet like perfectly,  not too tight just the perfect fit honestly, cant wait for it to rain so i can bust them out, so glad i decided to buy them! they're def worth it!": "5", "I've had these for a little over a month and so far so good. Fit great, look stylish, comfy for long hikes/walks, and not to mention they have amazing grip to the floor. I was on the fence on buying these considering the price tag but once I had these and compared the quality I 100% recommend. Worth the money take care of your feet.": "5", "I loved the shoes and used them a lot for hiking snd also work. The reason I am % adidas supporter.": "5", "My favorite shoe ever I would recommend this shoe to everyone this is my second pair I've owned": "5", "Really protective and comfortable.  I wear them everyday for work.": "5", "It'd be lovely to have waterproof shoes for Women that are sleek and not bulky like these! The color is great too!": "4", "First pair of Ultraboost Terrex! (Will be doubling up) I love everything about these shoes. GoreTex! Boost! I love the lacing and laces! I appreciate the sole that is complete without the usual cutouts on bottom that expose the boost. I got the all black for work. I did 8 hours outside under 20 degrees in the snow and my feet did not even get too cold! Kept feet dry, stable, comfortable and helped my energy.": "5", "Been waiting for these to come in stock and finally got a pair, worth the wait!": "5", "It's raining, so, of course I don't want to wear my NEW Gore-tex boots in the rain. So I can't wear them until the rain stops. They seem very comfortable wearing them around the house waiting for the rain to stop. They'll be ready to wear in the rain by this time next year.": "5", "There pretty good to wear nice to have very comfortable": "5", "This is an excellent shoe/boot, the comfort of boost with the properties of gore tex. Also has some extra toe room, stay true to size because this isn't primeknit.": "5", "Definitely my go to shoe from now on for whatever I do outdoors.": "5", "Have had shoes for over a week and am loving them. Sizing is great and gives all day comfort. Walking in them is effortless. Another great Adidas purchase.": "5", "Have had shoes for over a week and am loving them.  Sizing is great and gives all day comfort.  Walking in them is effortless.Another great Adidas purchase.": "5", "These shoes were purchased to go hunting.  They became more than that!  They have been my house-demo shoes, everyday errand shoes, running shoes, moving heavy equipment shoes.  These things are awesome.  Very comfortable.  Never had a pair of shoes I really didn't care if I never took them off.  Very comfortable.  I am a size 14 and they fit perfectly.  No cramping, plenty of room.": "5", "I was able to hike on the trail in the darkness with ease. Looking forward to more outings. Comfort was good, let's see about durability in a year.": "5", "if youre into anything outdoors you have to get you a pair": "5", "I love these boots. They are very comfortable and light for hiking boots. I even wear them around the house all day.": "5", "I highly highly recommend this shoe to anyone! The boost sole makes so much difference it's better than my NMD but has support and waterproof!": "5", "The best shoes for hiking ever I like its comfortable": "5", "NJ recently recently got hit with a snowstorm. But of course I live on the shore and we got rain & FLOODS. Out of all nights I decide to order tacos. I think,  well I'll just walk the few blocks in the rain I'll be fine. As soon as I get to the corner, it's completely under water. Ankle deep. Welp too late to turn back I go through the water, and more water and more water but when I got home. My feet were the only thing dry. Would definitely purchase again.": "5", "First purchase of this model and it is very comfortable. The sleek all black look is my style. Recommend for all terrain.": "5", "Light, snug, waterproof an ideal daily for me. If only it was steel toe": "5", "Highly recommend  very comfortable durable softer good for any occasion": "5", "Love Everything ( most everything) about this shoes. Perfect fit, Fantastic comfort, Size is right on the money. But the shoelaces needs improvement. Single knot, double knot it doesn't matter, in  an hour or so it is coming undone.    I will gladly add another star whern it is improved.": "4", "To be fair, my size seems to fluctuate between 8.5 and 9. I don't like my hiking boots exact so I opted for a 9, taking in account if I decide to go with socks or not. Strangely enough, but positively, the 9 fits perfectly whether sockless (to accentuate the ankles) or not. They're just more secure of a fit with socks. I really love these because you can actually rock them as stylish shoes, as well as, for hikes they're so versatile and comfortable. I tried different types of hiking boots, hands down these are the best aesthetically and functionally being strong enough for difficult hikes, but stylish enough for a night out hitting the socially distanced bars- pre-/ post corona(I'm here from the future).": "5", "The best water proof shoes you could buy if your into sneakers and need a boot like shoe": "5", "Great shoe love the way they look and feel when I just received them my dog and I went for a 10 mile hike had no problems. Come summertime they probably will be a little too warm because of the goretex .": "5", "Good material and very warm. Style is nice. Would definitely recommend them to my coworker": "5", "Love these boots! Half size too big but im guessing for thicker socks itll fit great!": "5", "This is a fantastic boot if you're looking for a traction greater than a running shoe.It definitely has a well designed outer soul for light duty trail hike/run and urban settings.Size is true to slightly small. I always wear a 10.5 in adidas, which allows for a little extra room.  However, the Gore-Tex liner takes up a small amount of space. If you want to wear a thicker sock in these you may want to 1/2 size up!These are a great everyday light duty trail run/hiker with a secure fit, great traction, and stable ankle support.I don't think I can  recommend them for heavy trail hiking, but with that said, I LOVE these!   Very, VERY comfortable and should hold up well for their intended use.": "5", "There were comfortable but ran at least a size 2 big": "3", "I love the Goretex in these boots! They have an amazing water-resistant property and the tread is also extremely grippy (thanks Continental!). These are my go to shoes for snow, hiking, and to deal with any invliment weather or conditions I might face!": "5", "I was told that this shoe run big, so I took this individual advice and went a half size down. That was a mistake because the shoe is tight on my toe. Overall it's a comfortable boost shoe, I have/had  many pairs of boost in the past/present. I ordered a size 10, and should've stuck with the 10.5.": "5", "Comfortable, good fit, waterproof. These are great for tougher terrains": "5", "Absolutely the best. Comfort is out of this world. Thank you Adidas for making larger sizes. I'm usually a 13 but I always size up with Adidas. So I went with a 14 and it's perfect. The shoes are perfect for hiking or wet weather. Extremely cold weather idk. Might need a size 15 and some big socks.": "5", "Extremely comfortable and light-weight.  Very stylish and great looking boots.": "5", "quality materials used in this product and very comfortable to wear": "5", "excellent product as always in Adidas comfortable perfect as seen on the page soft, comfortable likewise fits super well": "5", "Great for off road forest hikes or just in general wear": "5", "Easy to put on and take off, wear this shoe for work and is the most comfy shoe without looking to much like sneakers": "5", "This is like the marathon shoe for hiking. Very well constructed shoe.": "5", "Super comfortable shoe, especially because it has the boost material...genius! Love the Continental sole. Good quality, seems durable. Haven't tested how waterproof it is, but the Gore-Tex definitely repels the water from the shoe upper.": "5", "Keeps feet dry through light water crossings. Drys fast and rarely slips if at all. Would definitely recommend to a friend.": "4", "Honestly didn't think I'd like these as much as I have. I've hiked in them, walked in the neighborhood in them, wore them in rain, etc. Basically my favorite shoe. I've honestly thought about buying a backup pair for when these suckers wear out (hopefully years from now)! If you're on the fence, go ahead and buy them. The sole is solid, the color scheme is ideal, and they are real cozy on your feet.": "5", "The sole is very comfortable runs just a little too big and needs some ankle support however still very comfortable to walk in.": "4", "I absolutely recommend these boots. By far the most comfortable boots I've ever worn. The quality is palpable.": "5", "Good looking shoes, comfortable, and waterproof.The only thing I did not like is that it can be a struggle to put on.": "5", "Researched endless for a winter shoe that could be considered for flat pedal bike riding though the shoe was never advertised as such I took the chance mainly due to its claim about being water proof and having a mid style design. Being it is claimed on being a top notch hiking shoe I gave it a try. After several days out mountain bike riding I am able to concentrate on my riding and not about having cold feet in the 30 degree weather. The shoes are working in my favor. For the shoe to be considered a premium bike riding shoe in my opinion would need to have just a tad more firm sole but not a deal breaker they make up for it in comfort and design. Being I only wear the shoes for bike riding I am assuming that I will not wear them out real soon. Would I purchase again we'll time will only tell but must confess I do love the shoes.": "5", "Just received and the fit like socks that are clouds you can go anywhere in! The quality appears to be durable and scratch resistant.": "5", "ABSOLUTLY THE MOST COMFORTABLE BOOT I HAVE EVER PUT ON MY FEET. I WORK IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OM CONSTANTLY ON MY FEET. I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ALL MY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS . LOOKING TO GET ANOTHER PAIR ASAP, AS SOON AS MY SIZE IS AVAILABLE AGAIN!": "5", "The best hiking in the country. Very comfortable. Did a 10 mile hike straight out the box. Can't wait to get back to Colorado.": "5", "Really great show. Solid construction, and the waterproofing Gore-tex really comes through. Able to walk in shallow streams without getting wet at all. Comfy shoe, but I've had more comfort from more expensive hiking boots. That being said this is a solid hiking shoe for short and medium length hikes. Though I'd rather go for more durable, more expensive hiking boots, you can get decent performance for all day hikes.": "5", "These boots are great for rainy days.  The goretex material are perfect.  This boot feels just like a sneaker.  Highly recommend.": "5", "Probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I bought these for work and they are perfect for being on my feet all day on concrete. Great quality. They do run a little big size wise but not by much.": "5", "Comfortable and water proof, on my second pair.  Definitely got my money's worth.": "5", "Best comfort and every step on rocks is like stepping on clouds.": "5", "Bought this for work and so far loved it, very comfy and it doesn't hurt your feet will keep buying more in different styles and colors.": "5", "Really, the best purchase ever this summer. Style and function are all on point.": "5", "The quality is great and very comfortable for long hours.": "5", "It's a nice shoe. I'm not sure what it expected but perhaps it may have a little structure to it it's a little of the flimsy side but it's not intended to be a winter shoe so it's fine.": "4", "Had the shoe a little over a month. Been a great hiking shoe and very comfortable. Slightly wide in the toe box. I'd recommend going down half a size, unless you have super wide feet. Having the boost and and rubber tread are great for steep hill hikes over wet rocks. Make sure to wear socks that go above the shoe. I wore ankle socks my first day and the back of my heal was worn raw were the heal loop meets the back of my foot. Wearing longer socks solved the issue. But for a premium shoe I would have expected this not to happen. That's the reason for my 4/5 stars.": "4", "stability is mad crazy and super comfy would definitely cop another pair in a different colorway": "5", "Gore-Tex never fails. Premium material with exceptional comfort.": "5", "Great traction meets crazy comfort. Favorite hiking boot by far.": "5", "I can do anything in these - steal your girl, fly to the moon, become president . . thanks Adidas.": "5", "It's comfortable and light. Easy on the feet. Love the extra sturdy toe cover.": "4", "Amazing terrex silo that you know and love with GTX. Boot is slightly warm due to GTX but nothing more than expected. Size runs about half size large. Go TTS if for hiking to accomodate swelling. Otherwise you can size down.": "5", "This is the best waterproof shoes I ever buy. Can wait to get my next pair": "5", "Truly the best free hikers I love the all black look the fit is perfect super comfortable,high quality,amazing !": "5", "The gore-tex is dope. Super comfy when running up the hills.": "5", "These shoes are waterproof, stylish, durable and comfortable. I always get compliments on them! Love the boost midsole and upper primeknit it fits amazing! I live in New Orleans where it always rains so these shows are excellent protection.": "5", "Goretex is excellent in the rain. Worth the extra money": "5", "great look, need improvement for fitment, price too high": "3", "So I have been using my hardens for hiking and they were fine but I know I'll put my foot in the water so I had to look for something waterproof. So I saw this shoe and I was like I needed this so o bought it and used it and it was perfect. Plus some extra comfortwith the boost. Amazing show overall.": "5", "Awesome shoes! Definitely worth the money and recommend.": "5", "Great walking shoes I've ever had.Super comfortable, great stability and waterproof.I really enjoy wearing my free hiker.": "5", "These shoes have proven to be worth the purchase. Here in NC, it's been raining nonstop and I've been using these daily. Not only do they keep my feet completely dry, but they also give my ankles support.  Its a great shoe.": "5", "Super comfortable but not waterproof. They withstood a total of 16 hrs of typical rain before the jig was up": "1", "I love it this is my third pair and counting. I hope to see it on more color ways": "5", "First I must say this, the amount of comfort that this shoe has made me feel is incredible and outstanding I must say. The cloud white texture brings the most out of my exercises, 10/10 would recommend.": "5", "Super comfortable. These hiking books make trail hiking feel effortless!": "5", "Very comfortable, great traction and waterproof. Good support. I really enjoy wearing these boots.": "5", "Best hiking shoes I've ever owned. No problems at all.": "5", "I bought these primarily to hike. Because of the often rainy climate that I live in (North West Arkansas) they've become an almost daily driver. I love that I can wear them on the trails and even to the office. Free Hikers with Goretex is a must have. Boost gives them all day comfort. I'm very tempted to get the triple black pair!": "5", "Just buy it they are worth the money for sure. Very confortable, you can wear it all day, they do not get hot or at least no like other shoes that are waterproof.": "5", "Shoe material got torn on the second time of use hiking.": "3", "Most comfortable hikers for every day wear. Liked them so much I bought a second pair in gore tex": "5", "A very comfortable, lightweight hiking boot! Love the grip on the bottom of the hoe, and the goretex to keep it waterproof!": "5", "This shoes are great comfort and durability and water repellent, better than regular UB.": "5", "I walked a marathon in these and they were outstanding for any off road sections, and along with them being extremely comfortable and supportive. Would definitely recommend for hiking. Make sure you get the correct size as the sock collar may rub up against you achilles' tendon!": "5", "Wanted to share my fit bc I was nervous about the M/W conversion \u2014 I'm a women's 9 and the men's 8 fits perfectly (as recommended by the sizing chart). Excited to get more wear out of these. Really comfortable so far.": "4", "Super comfortable and breathable. Great on all types of terrain.": "5", "Love these Free Hikers in all black gortex! Second pair of Adidas Free Hikers do not disappoint!": "5", "great work shoe. forgot that adidas run big but fit nicely with additional support inserts.": "5", "See above, they feel like sneakers though they are  BOOTS!": "5", "I use them for disc golf and they are the best thing I've ever put on. Excellent grip through the mud and I've stood in an ankle deep creek and my feet stayed 100% waterproof": "5", "I wear these all day after working on a golf course. Keeps my feet nice and dry from a light rain to downpour. Want a second pair!": "5", "These shoes are what they are and more! Waterproof, comfortable for all day wear and sleek! Had to but another pair": "5", "Amazing! Bought two pairs honestly, so comfy, they look sleek, get the job done with comfort and water protection. Highly recommended": "5", "These shoes are great for all conditions. The Gore-TEX is of course exceptional at waterproofing and the shoe feels sturdy and rigid, yet flexible enough to handle agility. The only drawback is that the tongue is not waterproofed so if you are trodding in greater than 4 inches of water, you may get wet inside the shoe.": "5", "Love the product, very comfortable its gore tex and its waterproof.": "5", "I really wanted to love these shoes. They run about a half size smaller than Ultraboots and run pretty narrow. When I sized down though and found the best fit, the ribbed prime knit upper stretches and shows the color between the ribs, making it look like its bulging out.Another thing is that the rubbery left toe area right after the gore-tex is ripply. The right shoe doesn't have this issue.However, my biggest gripe is the white pull tab with \"420\" proudly printed on it. Who decided that put \"420\" on it? It's as equally a bad idea as putting \"69\" on your shoes. Unfortunately, I've decided to send them back for this reason.": "4", "These are perfect with the waterproof upper and the black ultra boost sole. Super comfortable as well.": "5", "I own two pairs.  My GTX Hikers are used mainly for working at the farm.  They have great traction and get pretty trashed.  At the end of the day, I just spray them down.  My feet appreciate staying dry from the elements.  Compared to my regular Hikers, I wish the GTX elastic collar was tighter around my ankles to keep small rocks out.  Other than that, fantastic hiking shoes used for work.": "5", "I have wider feet and I was worried that this would make the shoes hurt my feet but I found that they are just the right fit! The shoes can and have already taken a beating with no real damage. I have gone on some simple hikes with friends who had sneakers on and I was able to march ahead through mud and streams while they needed to find a way around. On the harder hikes, the boost cushioning provides maximum comfort without losing stability. The continental rubber outsoles give me the grip that I need to climb up rocky inclines and down steep hills without worrying about falling.": "5", "I wanted a pair of boots that were comfortable for long periods of use. I would always think why hasn't adidas made a pair of boots as comfortable as a pair of ultraboost sneakers. You have no idea how elated I was when I found out that adidas did just that with the terrex boots. High quality boots made for long term use.": "5", "I use these for work and are great if your on your feet all day.": "5", "Feel like a combination of hiking boots and running shoes.": "5", "Great hiking shoes that not only have ultra boost but also has good all black color and waterproof features.": "5", "Very light, comfortable and the gortex is awesome. Easy to clean also": "5", "Black, goretex and boost- perfect for what I was looking for in this shoe": "5", "Super comfy use them for work do tons of walking & have to wear books 8 hrs + a day": "5", "first time trying trail shoe from adidas, it worth to try!": "5", "the first time i put them on, did not want to take them off, felt wonderful on my feet. did not like the price but after wearing them i will buy again. would like to see some different colors just to make girlfriend happy.": "5", "The Free Hikers are by far the most comfortable shoe I've worn (compared to Yeezys and Ultra Boost) the opening of the shoe has a sock like material that makes sure you foot is in there snug as well as keeping out rocks and other small debris. These are perfect for hiking and for exploring cities or walking around theme parks all day. Would definitely recommend especially if you enjoy hitting the trails!": "5", "Waterproof hiking shoes with boost! Best hikers I've ever worn.": "4", "Great shoe if you work outside on rugged terrain and do a lot of walking back and forth from the work site to the temporary office.": "5", "If you need a hiker for these apocalyptic times, then look no further.": "5", "Great comfort. Recommended for warmer weather. Hope they last. Great traction on bottom": "5", "My second pair. So glad they came out in GTX and Blk on blk": "4", "I use these for work and man do I float. The boost is amazing and the gore Tex is a life saver. I was get a half size up when it comes to boost due to the size of my foot. I've never had a problem when I do that.": "5", "I like this shoe because its very light and comfortable.": "5", "New favorites for sure!! Might buy a second pair just to have on deck": "5", "This is my second pair that I have ordered. But if you prefer your boots to be a bit snug I suggest ordering a half size down as these run a little bit large.": "5", "I thought that this free hiker would wear like a mid ultraboost that is waterproof , but they don't wear quite like an ultraboost. You stand a lot taller in them, the boost is much thicker. Though this does not compromise lateral stability, which is considerably greater than an ultraboost. When you walk in them, the curve of the outsole quite literally propels you forward, which is nice.I was expecting to be able to wear them for hiking, golfing, and even casually on occasion... but they wear more like a boot than a trainer, which isn't a bad thing just not my style.I wear a size 10.5 ultraboost, so I ordered a 10 which would have fit great with a thicker sock but with a normal sock it was still a little roomy.Didn't get to test out the durability or waterproofness of them, but the quality of the materials were great.": "5", "Amazing shoes. The comfort level is unreal, These shoes are perfect for hiking.": "5", "whenever Adidas adds a lining to the outside of the ultraboost the shoe gets smaller in the toe box. A 14 UB will fit me perfectly but any of these or the all terrains and they are just too small. IDK why we can't fix this problem.": "1", "Really like this shoe, it's literally everything I want. But would you please make smaller women's sizes please please": "4", "I absolutely love this shoe. Very comfortable and seems to be very well built! I would love to have this shoe in all black with black soles but I would take this shoe in just about any color": "5", "A nice hiking shoe for mixed trails. Good traction and cushioning. I sized down by half and the fit is great.": "5", "It is going to be amazing for my trip to the snow. Can't wait to use them": "5", "as a mailman with plantar fasciitis who walks 11 miles/ day, i have tried just about everything. these worked. the boost midsole has literally transformed my job from torture each step to incredible comfort each step. even hours after taking them off, or next morning. pain is GONE.i am often complimented on how good they look.i love the gaiter-like built in sock, love the continental traction, love the lightweight, the durability, the breathability, everything but the not waterproof. i need a pair of the gtx. but cannot find my size anywhere. too bad.want to sell a pair to every mail carrier in the us??? build them waterproof, warm and with built in replaceable carbide spikes for ice.": "5", "Fits perfectly, provides comfort when walking.....": "5", "I don't like them , I LOVE THEM!!!!Very Comfortable, and good looking too.": "5", "Comfy, stylish, and functional. Love to wear in the rain, no water gets through.": "5", "This shoe fits extremely comfortable, but can certainly hold up to all weather conditions.  The toe box is comfortable and will support thin and thick socks.": "5", "This boot is so comfortable. Many boots on the market require some breaking in time. These do not.": "5", "I really like comfort of the boost sole and adding gtx is better addition to the sneaker. I would like see more black boost soles.": "5", "Looks good and functional for trail..\u2026am I getting paid for my time? Went from 5 to 4 star": "4", "I have done a few hikes over various terrains and these shoes have the best tech for all of them. They're lightweight, have a comfortable ride, incredible traction. My feet don't get wet when I wear them and I've never got any sand or rocks in them.": "5", "These shoes are very comfortable and waterproof. They are true to size. The only concern is that the top part of the shoes is a little tight, which is designed to prevent sands and mud from getting in.": "5", "Nice shoe. Fit well like the style. Was expecting a little more comfort like the ultra boost but for the money.": "5", "Amazing fit, support and comfort! Light and stylish, one of my favorite hiking and every day shoe of allTime!": "5", "Definitely thought the look in the pictures was my style. Even better in person. They are very comfortable as well. The material also seems like it will hold up even better than expected. Great score !": "5", "Only complaint is that they are a little snug, but then again, I think shoes for the trail need to be. The added support through the arch and heel is fantastic. And they look excellent, too!": "5", "I like the comfort and quality and the style is very nice it makes it easy for long distance walking I like the way the flap is designed when I tie the laces it doesn't feel to tight overall I'm very pleased and feels like I got my money's worth.": "5", "Great colorway and design with solid construction and good traction. I particularly like the inner lip protecting small pebbles from seeping in around the ankles. These will be my new go tos for day hikes.": "5", "Very comfy runner.  best in the business with the quality.": "5", "Perfect footwear for my daily exercise program which means walking miles on trails.": "5", "Somewhere between a hiking boot and sneaker. Very comfortable but with added support. Just took them on a 7 mile hike and they performed better than I could have imagined.": "5", "They are perfect for the outdoors! Went on a hike recently in these and feet were completely dry when I finished! I also used them in the snow, kept my feet warm. I want sure if I needed shoes for the outdoors but these proved me wrong! 10/10!": "5", "I bought these green waterproof trail shoes to replace similar OnCloud Up (whatever that brand is called) shoes that I misplaced. The shoes are competent all the way around and cost 30% less. They are a bit snug, however.What I like about these and most of the new Adidas designs is the variety of materials and colors incorporated into the same shoes. They have a look of thoughtfulness.": "4", "Arthritis has hindered my hiking pleasures.  But these shoes have been like a trip to the doctor!  My knees are 5 years younger.": "5", "I found this shoes for a price less than 20 dlrs. The quality of these pair of shoes is amazing. They are comfortable and are recommended for hiking": "5", "I loved the color and comfort. I recommend it to everyone and very suitable, especially for hiking.

Not only that ' i see this shoes is so tought the looks ' the fabric perfectly made !": "4", "These were comfortable, except in the toe box. The shoe was just too small, so I had to return them. I have four pairs of Adidas in 11, but these needed to be 11.5 or 12.": "3", "This is my fourth pair of Adidas trail shoes, and this pair has met my expectations for fit, comfort, and style.  Being an amputee, the wear and tear I put on one of my shoes is very uneven, so I like a shoe with a lot of durable tread.  I anticipate that this shoe will last a full year, like my other Adidas / Terrex shoes have.": "5", "They look stiff but are quite comfy when on.  I wear 10.5 usually and like some newer adidas they are touch wide in toe box so feeling a little big.  This is ok with me because I know 10 would be too small for my comfort - I'm ok with a little room.": "4", "Great support. Shoe is a bit narrow for my slightly wider foot however I think after a few wears, I can break them in. Shoe has a great grip for hiking. Very comfortable during long hiking trails. Would recommend for sure.": "4", "Everything about the shoe looked and felt great except the big toe area.  The only issue I had was that my big toe needed a little bit more room.  A half size bigger would've been perfect, but size 13 was largest they had.  Will have to return.": "4", "Brought these for running and they are very comfortable.": "5", "Quality is outstanding. They look good but feel good too.": "5", "Good  and fast shipping. Packing is good..........": "5", "I love the comfort of the boost shoes but typically have to get the stability version of them. The regular ultraboost don't fit my feet very well or provide enough support for my flat feet.I tried these on and was super happy with the comfort and support. They are comfortable with a stable feel. More importantly, my feet don't hurt after wearing all day. These wrap around my feet well with no slipping. I have extremely flat and narrow feet.My only disappointment is I wasn't able to try these on and buy sooner.": "5", "Great fit! I'm a size 9 in Womens shoes, bought M8/W9 and the fit was perfect. Very comfortable, roomy toe area so my toes are not squeezed together. I just purchased a second pair because I can see myself wearing these not only in the gym. Recommend!": "5", "Bought these for my husband and love them and the unique design! he texture of the sides of the soles is unique, but also make them a magnet for dust inside all the grooves. I wash our shoes regularly so it isn't a huge issue, but for those that are in dirt or dus regularly, I would pick a different shoe.  Overall very happy with this purchase!": "5", "Super nice and comfy I'll recommend them to any body that like to run.": "5", "Extremely comfortable.

I gave 4 stars just because I don't used it for a while yet.. Maybe to others might need to get half size up, I would, if I'm not lazy to exchange it but then I chose to just keep it and use thinner socks...and it works great!": "4", "They are not comfortable on the top. The bottom is perfect, excellent.": "3", "The prime knit top is excellent and extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this product.": "5", "I think is the best product that at this moment I have.

My feet were hurting so I returned very next day and ordered another pair with the same for as my previous pairs": "2", "Responsive shoe, a little on the heavy side.  Great quality and support.": "4", "For some reason I feel as though there is a sizing difference between different versions of the shoes. When I buy a particular line of ultra booze I have to choose a size that is smaller than what I would typically wear. But when I did that with this shoe it was dangerously close to being too small. It isn't so bad that I need to return it, but if you're close in sizing, keep the size you normally wear in most shoes.": "4", "Would definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for comfortable and stylish shoes": "5", "Fit is great, not as soft as the ultraboost but overall a comfortable shoe": "5", "Great pair of sneakers , fit perfect and would recommend.

Overall very comfortable!!": "4", "Just got mine today, they good looking but the cushion is not what I'd expected": "5", "I was excited when these shoes dropped, but wasn't excited after my first run.

Great for a really comfortable.": "5", "Feet feel like floating in these .Feel and look Space age . Only flaw not weatherproof": "5", "I love Adidas shoes I was told by all the other girls I work with at the hospital how comfortable they are and that they are worth the money so I finally decided to buy and pair bc my feet were killing me and I absolutely love them. Once I bought one pair and felt how comfortable they are I ended up buying 2 more pairs and a pair for my sister. Also I love the variety of colors!!!": "5", "Bought these for my husband, he says they are very comfortable. He usually buys the ultra boost 20s' and he is doing a comparison of comfort. He says these feel more secure. But the comfort is almost the same as the ultra boost 20. Over all great comfortable shoe! I have already ordered myself a pair.": "5", "The comfort is good so far.  The quality seems like it's holding up, but I've only worn them three times so far.  Wait and see.  All in all, happy with my purchase so far.": "5", "Get them - if you can!!  You will not be disappointed!!": "5", "These shoes are really interesting. Unlike the  Ultraboost, that spring and recoil as you walk, these absorb everything.": "5", "Another homerun from ADIDAS aka the only shoe brand that will ever touch my feet!The Ultra 4D 5.0 look amazing in person and the comfort is second to none!Buy with confidence!!!": "5", "The best running shoe, work shoe,etc. You will never need another shoe.

Super comfortable for running": "5", "They are so comfortable and I love the color of them.": "5", "While they're a little heavier than the Ultraboosts, I do believe that for walking and just standing for longer periods (which I do for my job), the Ultra 4D may be more comfortable. I will hopefully get more in the future (as long as they broaden their color schemes).": "5", "I've been buying Adidas for 15 years and this is honestly a problem with some previous shoes. Although they have seem to correct the narrow foot issue it seems to be back with this new shoe.": "1", "Bought 10 different ultra boosts over the last year. My first 4D.

Love these shoes and would definitely purchase again": "5", "Loved the colors and the fact that the sole is one piece printed in 3D": "5", "The cushioning on the 4D is perfect.

Definitely very comfortable and super supportive, but my flat feet seem to get sore in even these after a day of standing in the hospital. I'd still recommend them as a solid supportive shoe. Although I wouldn't recommend running if them if you have flat feet, my arches were aching after 10 minutes!": "4", "I have had multiple pairs of these shoes for marathon training. I love them! They fit perfectly  like a glove. They feel great when running, responsive with the perfect amount of cushion": "4", "I purchased this pair of sneakers in size 6 for my 10 years old boy for late spring/summer.

Was going to order another pair in a different color and I am having a hard time finding any ultra boost in my size.": "5", "This shoe would benefit a better insole.

I have always purchased adidas for this reason. I would say that these are true to size for me. I wear a 9.5 but because I have a wider foot I usually need to size up. With adidas I never need to do that. I orderd a 9.5 and the fit was spot on. Just wish the white stayed white longer!!!!": "5", "I can't say enough good things about this shoe!! They are super cute for one and the comfort is amazing, it supports my arch perfectly (I have a medium to high arch). I tend to get sore feet after all day running about but these do not let that happen! For wise I'm normally in between 10.5-11 I have a pair in each size, 10.5 is just right fits like a sock I got a size up for the days I want a looser fit. Tighter fit is great for running around or working out so that you're not tripping on yourself. Over all I recommend the ultra boosts to everyone I know!": "5", "My wife is happy with them great buy will recommend to anyone who wants them to get them!!!": "5", "Super comfy. Have to loosen the laces a bit but not too tight": "5", "I have 2 other pair of Ultra Boosts in size 7 that fit perfectly. Ordered these in a 7 and they are too big.

Had to go with my typical size and was worried, but it is the correct fit and feels great. They look sharp!": "5", "I've always had knee problems running, so I would wear orthopedics, but after wearing these shoes I realized I just never had the right shoe on. These are a game changer!! They are so comfortable to wear throughout any workout!": "5", "These are the most comfortable ultraboost I ever had. I have just ordered another pair of the same shoes.": "5", "Very comfortable for those who stand on their feet all day": "5", "These are well made of high quality materials. I would recommend these shoes to anyone. Shoe technology really has advanced, and I wish the designers of the Ultraboost 20 knew what a difference they're making. Perfect amount of room for your foot to expand. So comfortable.": "5", "Great fit, this is the first time I've tried adidas brand. My husband talked me into trying them. I've always worn orthotics in my gym shoes, No Need to put in my new adidas... I'm hooked! thank you for making a great gym shoe.": "5", "Great for work. Nice stability. Wish could lace up more for that support. Otherwise a fantastic shoe.": "4", "Have recommended this shoe to many.  Will continue buying them in all colors.": "5", "Super comfy shoes.  They run big so go a 1/2 size down.": "5", "Great looking shoe with a lot of support in the heel and arch, which is what I was looking for.": "5", "I may not put my feet in any other athletic shoe! This is my 5th pair of Ultraboost, and I love them. MY feet needs extra support and that is what I am getting!": "5", "They look great and they're comfortable. My son can't wait to go somewhere just so he can where them!": "5", "The product has good quality and they are very confortable": "5", "The shoes are comfortable for the most part but the width felt a little narrow to me. And then it widened out a bit too much at the toes so I couldn't tell if these sneakers were too big for me or if this is how it's supposed to fit. But other than that, it is comfortable!": "4", "They should just rename it \"UltraBEST\" because it's so incredibly comfortable.  The stretch mesh upper enhances the fit and the back boost keeps the grime invisible.  Awesomeness.": "5", "These are hands down the most comfortable running shoes I have ever owned!  I have \"problem\" feet and it is extremely difficult for me to find comfortable shoes.  Highly recommend!": "5", "I was on the market for new running/work out shoes. After weeks of research I decided to purchase these. I'm so happy I did, I don't know why I waited so long to grab a pair. These shoes literally have changed the way I work out. I can run longer and my body hurts less after a hard gym or HIIT session. Just absolutely amazing. I wear a 7.5/8 in women's shoes and the 8 fit perfect.": "5", "The black on the foam was flaking off after two days.": "3", "These shoes look and feel great! Both my son and I love them!": "5", "I purchased these for my father, and he loves how comfortable these sneakers are!": "5", "Not as cushiony as I was hoping. They were also a little snug, but I have to wear insoles for arch support so that often takes up a lot of space and when there's no tongue to loosen it often makes the shoe not an option for me, I also thought the NASA decal and orange looked a little cheap.": "3", "Great shoes, definitely my new go-to's! So comfy! And I love the style with the little pop of color.": "5", "These are the most comfortable and supported shoe ever.": "5", "Some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever purchased. My daughter loves them.": "5", "The ultraboost offers style, comfort and the technology to ensure a great modern running trainer.": "5", "The comfort is unbelievable, after I break them in.": "5", "Looked through dozens of shoes on adidas looking for the perfect pair, read all the reviews and finally decided the Ultraboost 20 looked good for what I needed. Plus I couldn't beat the sale price! These are amazing for my long shifts on my feet and running errands afterwards, the comfort lasts all day.": "5", "Great feel, solid construction. They're a little expensive yes, but the quality matches the overall experience. You won't regret it.": "5", "The color scheme is awesome, the cushion on the bottom feels great, and I can't wait to run in them soon!": "5", "These are so light and comfortable. I've been hesitant to get a pair of ultra boosts and I already want more. They're insanely light and perfect for running! Love love LOVE": "5", "Totally recommend these so comfortable best shoes I've ever had": "5", "19s will always be my favorite. 20s are good too, just not as awesome for me as the 19s.": "5", "I always buy this model for running. Supportive and comfortable, win win.": "5", "This style appears to run small, ordered 11.5 but had to return for 12. I have Adidas in 11.5 but must have 12 in this style, no wiggle room. Some reviews claimed glitter ruined the look. I barely noticed the small amount but not concerned. Purchased these for workouts and it's a great choice. Fits like a glove and the cushioned bounce is great. Can actually feel the bounce. Best choice for anyone with lower extremity issues, such as bad knees, arthritis, etc. Ordering another pair different color today!": "4", "I love the breath ability of the site, the comfort... it was a great purchase.": "5", "Great look! Great fit! Very comfortable!  I own several pairs of Ultraboost shoes and these are my favorite!": "5", "I have been a Boost fan since inception. So when I saw these Boost 20's which I did not have pair of in those colors the choice was easy. Seems like there is more cushion which is always good.": "5", "I own several pairs.

These shoes are so comfortable and the support is perfect.": "5", "I really, really, REALLY want to like these shoes. The aesthetic was on point but after running for ten minutes my feet started to hurt and I couldn't walk after my workout because my feet were cramping so bad. I have flat feet that aren't used to proper support so proper support tends to hurt them so I'm really hoping that maybe they just have to adapt. They are fine for walking but running is proving to be a little problematic.": "3", "I was on a hunt for the 'most comfortable sneakers' for 12 hr shifts and let me tell you, I'm in love with these!! Not only are they extremely comfortable, they're also good for wider feet which is what I struggle to find! By far the best purchase and worth every penny": "5", "I love the gray and white combo. Ultra boost are the most comfortable. I wear them all day at work and then for a run. Look great and hold up well.": "5", "The best shoe , my 8th pair, don't mess with them. My son gave me my first pair.": "5", "This was the first Ultra Boost I found in a 12 1/2, which fits perfect. Wish they made all the Ultra Boost selections in 12 1/2. I usually wear a 12 in most sneakers, and they were a bit snug. The size 13 was just a little too big. But I love the comfort!!": "5", "My new favorite pair of shoes. Comfortable and beautiful design.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe, great cushion inside. Made of quality materials,  would highly recommend. These are my first pair of ultra boost and im hooked on them.": "5", "Fits well and it looks good with their clothes!!!!": "5", "Really comfortable and love color combo.

Very comfortable": "5", "I'm in love with the style and comfort of this shoe. Perfect for workouts or just running errands.": "5", "I wore this shoe twice to workout on the treadmill and it caused my feet and shinsto hurt.  I can feel several hot spots on feet.I returned them.  Very disappointed.": "1", "It's like walking on clouds! I love Ultraboosts and these exceed the standard!": "5", "good job, good shoes, i like it, need it every day": "5", "I got this as my work shoe and they are SUPER 10/10 comfortable.": "5", "Really comfortable and lightweight.

Very comfortable, nicer than the other pair of Ultraboosts that I have which are also very good.": "5", "The black on black is great look and easy to clean! These fit great and are super comfortable. Def worth it": "5", "12 hrs shifts,  no problem with these awesome and comfortable pair of shoes!! Love them!!": "5", "I love them so far!! They are bigger than normal size but maybe that's the design for running and not cramming a foot into a shoe. They are very cushioned and sleek with the all black esthetic. They are pricey but I feel worth the investment. And I ADORE they are recycled material based. Adore.": "5", "Happy I loved this shoes and I will get more from here": "5", "I saw this shoe on a coworker and I had to try them for myself. Best decision made when picking the right shoe for perfect comfort": "4", "I've been using the ultra boost 20 since they came out. This is my second pair. Bought because I don't like the 21s.": "5", "This Ais my first pair of Ultraboost and I love them. Super comfortable & they look great. I've gotten tons of compliments in these shoes.": "5", "Loved Ultra Boost from afar, but getting these now after so many of my friends vouched for them is awesome": "5", "Adidas style can't be beat, wear them for whatever wherever. Walking, running, sprinting, strength training, you name it, this shoe provides the support and the comfort you need.": "5", "Feels like I'm walking on a cloud. I love the flexibility of the shoe. High quality product. Love the color.": "5", "I have flat, wide feet and foot and lower back pain, and these help so much. I'll definitely be buying a few more pairs!": "5", "The best and most supportive athletic shoes I've owned.

Haven't tried running in them yet but they seem like they will be comfortable and supportive.": "5", "A little pricey for what it is. Comfortable. Don't love the mesh on top": "4", "Lots of cousin on the heel though not too spongy and not too stiff either. Could use a bit more cushion in the mid sole though in comparison with the heel... not much there.. also upper is a tad tight. Overall not bad. Ran 10k a day all week in these. 7.5/10": "4", "This sneaker is super comfortable. You feel a supportive sole in the shoe while you run. It stretches to fit your foot and has a snug secure fit.": "5", "I really liked the Ultraboost 20s and bought 2 pairs of the Ultraboost 21 to add in my rotation.  I work out 4-5 days a week, doing cardio and weights.  And these feel really good on my feet.  I am not an avid runner, but as advertised, the additional boost feels more responsive and more cushioned.  If you liked the Ultraboost 20s, you'll like the upgrade on the Ultraboost 21s.  I am a heavy set guy, I've lost over 60 lbs in the last year, and have put my Ultraboosts through the test...": "5", "comfortable, good grip, and exactly like the pic": "5", "Bought these for the gym and lifestyle wear. On the heavier side for a running shoe so if you're looking for something to put hundreds of miles on I would look somewhere else.": "5", "Overall I love the shoe, the responsiveness, the comfort, breathable, smooth rides, just 13.2 oz is too heavy for running": "5", "Look good.  Incredibly comfortable.  Fits true to size.": "5", "They're great! The boost is really nice, and you can tell how responsive they are. They took a little bit of walking to get used to, and I accidentally tied the laces way too tight at first, but they're really comfortable and secure, and the fit is great! I have pretty narrow feet, so those with wider feet might want to try them on in-person. I got the triple-black colorway because it matches everything and it'll stay cleaner, and I couldn't find a purple one I was satisfied with. So, yeah, they're good!": "5", "Perfect fit and broken in feel right outta the box.": "5", "I definitely recommend these shoes because they are very comfortable and they are perfect for running and any other thing you want to do.": "5", "Best tennis shoes I own.

Will be buying a 2nd pair!": "5", "The shoes look amazing but the insoles are loose and move around alot.": "3", "Very comfy and they look good. Sizing might be off, go one size bigger": "5", "I use these for casual wear and love it": "5", "Great comfort, slightly small fitting. Wonderful shoe.": "5", "Great quality. Runs a little small as other adidas shoes fit well in my size. There's very little room for adjustment in this model. It's just too tight to be comfortable for all day wear. If I could exchange for 1/2 size larger then 5 stars.": "3", "These babies are SWEET!  Only downside is that I'm an silt now and none of my friends ask me how fast I can run in them.": "5", "Ultra boost series from adidas is my new goat shoes. I'm in my 30s and as I'm getting older and I care about comfort more and more, these sneakers are my new everyday. I have a few ultraboost in rotation but don't get me wrong they are stylish as well.

Y": "4", "Amazing Comfort , exceeded expectations. Great For Summer": "5", "Super comfortable and good quality. You can wear these shoes all day!": "5", "Comfortable, light weight, made with recycled material, fit is perfect.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe. At first it took a second to get used to the cushion around the ankle, but after that, super comfy, and very lightweight. Ten out of ten recommends..!": "5", "These shoes are perfect for running. I own several different pairs of running shoes, but nothing tops these. The design is very unique when it comes to what other brands are coming up with.": "5", "This shoe is narrow on the bottom wear your stepping, other wise its good. The souls of the shoe weren't glued down properly so they immediately came out after 1 use.. which will create havoc wrinkling and wearing down. Can find a better quality shoe for 100 dollars less.": "3", "These are amazing!  I have a somewhat wide foot and flat feet at that and these are perfect.  I've never been in the shoe is comfortable and they give this kind of bounce as you walk it feels like I'm floating.": "5", "Quick delivery. Beyind comfortable. Stylish.

They're stylish, comfortable, and all around a great buy!": "5", "There's a reason why these are the best selling running shoe. Way better than some other brands in comfort and fit. Plus they're made from recycled materials so your impact is lower on the environment.": "5", "I love them!!!!!!   But at first around the ankles they were a little snug  about a week of wearing them they feel great. everything else was great they are light , breathable and not hard at all they go with everything just a very comfortable shoe would definitely would recommend!!!!": "4", "I had to buy a half-size bigger than my TTS because it was too narrow.": "4", "Most comforting shoes I've ever owned.

I have high insteps so they are initially a bit tight, but after adjustment and break in their perfect.": "5", "As with previous models, the Ultraboost provides a good fit and plenty of comfort. Upper support could use some work, along with the price tag. The styling is excellent.": "4", "My boyfriend just went through treatment for a bulging disc or two and typically works on concrete. To keep up with his recovery I got him these shoes and boy does it help! From barely being able to survive an hour or so to making it up to 6-7 hours on concrete floors, these shoes are a game changer!My only complaint, is that he honestly needs a half size up and it caps at 12 (USM)": "5", "The comfiest shoe I have ever wear. This is one of my favourite!": "5", "Fit great. Comfortable. The black is rubbing off the sides!": "1", "Got a pair there very comfortable felt them a bit tight at first but they break in": "5", "Really comfortable shoe but gets my feet tired after a few hours mainly because I have slightly wider feet.

However, the durability of this shoe leaves way too much to be desired. I've had it for just over a month and worn it on a handful of occasions back and forth to buildings across the street. The sole has already worn all the way down, and the boost began cracking and separating away from the outsole. Paying that much money for a shoe that wears down after a few casual wears is not worth it at all.": "1", "Amazing quality, super comfortable, easy to match with clothes, can be worn to run/workout or casually. Great shoe.": "5", "Inferior quality!!!!   Will not hold up with normal wear.

Most comfortable sneaker for any activity": "5", "Ultraboost yet again fails to disappoint. Went with what others recommended and got a half size up. They run a bit narrow so half to one size up should be perfect. The color (yellow) is very vibrant and hasnt gotten dirty yet. Boost energy return is fantastic and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Overall, 9/10": "5", "I got these because I had an older set I loved that were very comfortable": "5", "Very comfortable when running,walking. Also is very comfortable when you are just standing.": "5", "I'm a wide footer. The shoe felt great and has a lot of room for your foot to move. However, the quality of the upper leaves a bit to be desired. First, the tongue on the right shoe was off center and leaned to the lateral side of the shoe. Second, the all black shoe shows its adhesive pretty well. Took them out of the box, tired them on, noticed the defect, and immediately asked for a return.": "4", "Runs a little on the big size, but I could wear this shoe every day for the rest of my life. Comfortable and the perfect color gray.": "5", "Best purchase. On time delivery. Shoes has a good quality and comfortable to wear": "5", "These are even more comfortable than the last ultraboosts which I didn't even think was possible. I love them and the bit of blue makes them so fun!": "5", "The shoe was a gift so it hasn't been worn yet; but the quality is as expected.

A sku for the proud boys crowd? Not subtle or cool.": "1", "Terrible quality as color on the sole peels off leaving the shoe with a terrible look. Adidas won't care and will ignore your complaints. Stick with the white sole.": "1", "Very comfy and amazing to workout in! Definitely love the fee of them!": "5", "There is nothing more comfortable on this earth.... to wear.... on your feet.... than Ultra Boost. I've got multiple pairs , millions of colorways,  comfort on 11 , they just can't be matched. This colorway is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 and works with almost every fit. The Oreo colorways are classic and make everyday wear easier. The upper is ultra comfortable,  it's like wearing an extra pair of socks,  if you are on your feet all day you couldn't do worse than a pair of ultra boost. Trust me when I tell you that you'll never regret this purchase.": "5", "Better then I expected with shoes light weight, comfort and grip.": "5", "Shoes overall are nice. They are a bit compressive around the toes, but I imagine they will stretch out the more I wear them": "5", "Love these shoes. Cosmetic and Ultraboost are greatI have high arches and my Ultraboost 20Are the best ever. These are tighter on my arch": "4", "I just wore these for the first time this weekend. I coach and am on my feet for long periods of time so I'm always looking for a good shoe to keep my feet and back comfortable through the day. First impression of the shoe was they felt like I was putting a second pair of socks. They were a little tight up front but felt great. They have loosened up through wearing them the past 2 days. If I were wearing these as a running shoe I would be concerned with the wear of the material on the outside of the shoe where the little toe would rub. After 2 long days of wearing them, I feel great. They were very comfortable and light weight. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable shoe.": "5", "Most comfortable shoe ever. I have 3 ultraboost now and will prob get more in the future. It's basically a slip on shoe, laces not needed. Ultraboost is super cushy for all day comfort": "5", "I bought these to replace 2 pairs of Boost shoes which were my perfect walking shoe. The original Boost had a wider footbed which gave amazing stability, especially when walking on side hills. These being narrower I feel I have to be a bit more aware of foot placement as to not pressure my ankle (would love to see a wider footbed offered again in the future). I also preferred that the originals were slightly firmer.  On the whole though, this is still a great shoe and significantly better than the 2 pairs I recently bought from 'the other guys'!": "4", "Feel like I'm walking in pillows, yet still supportive": "5", "Very comfortable and style is amazing. I'll recommend this product to  friends": "5", "Adidas never fails to give me the exact fit. The Bounce really does make a difference.": "5", "look good and good support": "4", "Great fit, comfort, and weight which helps justify the high price point.": "5", "These shoes are light weight and very comfortable. There are times I forget I'm wearing them as they are light weight and the fit is perfect": "5", "Love them!  Best shoes I ever bought so comfortable and love the cushion when running.": "5", "Feel great with socks or no socks, the traction on them is great also.": "5", "Love the shoe so far. The Ultraboost material is on par with other UB shoes I have bought before. The shoe is one piece, no separate tongue. It makes for a comfortable wear but, out of the box they are real tight and need a good amount of breaking in. My toes went numb due to the shoe being so tight initially. After a week or so, they have stretched out a little and are quite comfortable now.": "4", "Love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Great fit - great shoes!": "5", "My only suggestion is loosen up the laces and pretend they aren't there (you don't need them anyway they are there for the look) if you tie them they might cut off circulation and cause discomfort if you got fat feet or your feet swell since the shoes already fit snug by design. Besides that it feels like you're walking socks with soles.": "5", "These ultraboost fit my foot perfectly.  I have several pairs and will continue to purchase as long as they are available. So comfortable.": "5", "I love these shoes.  Very comfortable and easy to wear.  I will be getting more soon!": "5", "Very comfortable awesome shoes love em...love how they fit and a great looking shoe to boot": "5", "I purchased 2 pair of these in 2 different sizes, 12 and 13. Both of these sizes seemed to fix just fine, except the size 12 are just a tad to narrow. I kept them both because they did not offer a wide with size. The comfort is amazing and I would dare say the best sneaker I've owned to date.": "4", "The color way and comfort are excellent.  The lace set up and length need to be better. The laces do turns on the inside and outside of the shoe because of the eyelet configuration. Also there's absolutely no need for such a long shoelace for a 5 eyelet shoe. Shoelace length should be listed in description of shoe.": "4", "I really like this colorway. It's a really nice tone of gray and overall the shoe really pops. If you haven't already had a pair of Ultraboost's they are the most comfortable pair you'll have!": "5", "This is my 2nd pair of Ultraboosts. I use them as an everyday shoe and for working out. Ultra-comfortable and very stylish.": "5", "i like the colors, the boost is very soft and comfortable": "5", "Highly recommend! It is expensive but it is worth the money. The comfortability is out of this world. The design looks really nice!": "5", "An absolute incredible shoe.Dedicated comfort.Weight is like a feather.When opening the box wasn't sure anything was in it.I'm impressed.": "5", "These shoes look nice.  Not sure how comfortable they are yet. Normal size is a 10.  My foot was crammed in these like they were a size 9.  Waiting on an exchange to arrive.  Went up a whole size to an11.  Hope they fit. Deliver time on original order was fast. Hopefully the exchange will be as well.": "3", "Extremely comfortable!! Ultraboost are always the best for heal cushion.": "5", "They are very difficult to slip on.  The laces are for show only.  No way to widen the tongue area to make putting them on easier.": "3", "Love these shoes. My second pair. After years of trying to find the right athletic shoes for my feet I found them.": "5", "Highly recommended, great color. I will definitely buy more Ultra Boost 5.0 uncaged.

Perfect for everyday use.": "5", "Ive had this for a year, they still look as brand new. The texture of the shoe in genera makes it not to show any aging of it": "5", "I bought these shoes for work. I walk or stand for about 9 hours a day. These shoes are so comfortable": "5", "The shoe is not as comfortable as I expected it to be. The width of the shoe is too much for me but I can see that for a male or someone with wide feet would be okay with it.Overall, I do not feel it is worth the high price tag.": "4", "I waited and waited to buy ultra boosts because of the price tag. But I received them for my birthday and they were so worth the wait! SO comfortable for a day out walking but also perfect for my workouts. Flexible, not stiff, but provide a ton of support. I love love love them and will likely buy more pairs in the future.": "5", "My son loves these shoes, he's had several pairs, they fit really well and perfect for sports!": "5", "Very comfy and durable. Can't get enough of quality and style.": "5", "Love the all black colorway. Use these for work and have all day comfort. The Continental sole holds up very well and I track over all kinds of different surfaces": "5", "Ultra boost have been recommended to me for a long time by runners and I regret waiting so long to buy. They are so comfy and encourage proper form during a run. I ordered an 8.5 and received an 8 but didn't notice until I tried them on and determined they fit. (Typically an 8 in shoes but I always size up for running shoes.)": "5", "I bought this shoes for my dad, and he loves them. Initially I was going to buy him a pair of Ultraboosts, but he liked this pair better, he said they were really comfortable and sturdy. He wears them all the time.

It could be more water resistant, preferably water proof.": "5", "Fit like a glove. Plenty of support, light weight, stylish": "5", "these sneakers are the best.

I want a buy another one the same shoe lace": "5", "Hi, It rained the other day and forgot to leave a review... Im disappointed because this shoe is promotive that its water resistance. It didn't do to well! my feet got soaked and it looks like these are defective. I bought these specifically for New York City conditions.Extremely let down by this product.": "3", "Good looking shoes, but do run slightly smaller than normal for this type of shoe, but not enough that I returned them. They have been awesome.": "4", "SHOES ARE LITTLE TIGHT JUST A LITTLE NOT THAT BAD THROUGH, WHEN TRYING GET FOOT INSIDE OF THEM, BUT AFTER GET FOOT IN THEM THEY FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO ME. I WORKOUT IN THEM & JOGG IN THEM. ON A SCALE 1 TO 10  I GIVE THE SHOES A 9 JUST BECAUSE OF GETTING FOOT INSIDE OF THEM THAT IT.": "5", "One of the best fitting boost sneakers. They are true to size.": "5", "Comfortable shoes but could still feel moisture on feet after half hour walking during rainy morning": "4", "Great waterproof option, Now can run in snow in Chicago": "5", "Finally i managed to got this shoes. perfect for cold winter day.

Like the reflective materials.": "5", "Super value for the money. This is my second pair of Ultra Boost shoes, you can't beat the comfort.": "5", "The rubber lining opening make these shoes unnecessarily difficult to put on. Wearing these in cold temperatures are not as comfortable and it sounds. Toes were freezing even with wool socks. (Extremely difficult to put these shoes on with wool socks)": "2", "I like the cord string thing to tie my shoes but I honestly don't know how to take them off if I wanted to use the laces that came with it.": "4", "Love these sneakers. They're really grippy and provides good comfort. I have high arches so boost is a definite go to for me": "5", "Excellent Quality!! Comfortable, Great looking shoe!": "5", "I like these shoes. Bought them specifically to deal with winter running conditions in Wyoming, and they work really well. Rubbed me raw just below one ankle, on the outside of my foot, but that was before they were completely broken in. Only about 45 miles on these shoes, but they definitely are doing the job I bought them for: keeping my feet dry.": "5", "Have ran in ultra boosts for last three years. Grabbed these for water resistance. Found these too tight and not breathable enough. Ended up going with a gortex hoka atr shoe instead.": "3", "Shoes felt really warm and overall look is very appealing, had to return because I couldn't justify paying full price but will get in future!": "5", "Great running in cold days. Totally recommended. Always love the black core scheme.": "5", "I love my Ultraboosts, so I was thrilled to see a weather resistant version with a bit more traction. I wear size 15 for running and 16 for comfort, but the 15 in these was very cramped in the toe, even with a thin sock.": "4", "Love everything about them- with possible exception being that they can be a little tough to get on.": "5", "This is a quality shoe, but it's so hard to get on and off. I think there is rubber around the opening that restricts the access, and I have to fight to get them on and off. I can only hope that they will eventually break in, and loosen up. Once they are on, they are very comfortable, though. The no tie running laces are a plus as well.": "3", "A very comfortable shoes for your winter workout. Totally perfect in all aspects.

This is my 5 pair of boost that I've bought and they never disappoint.These came with an extra pair of shoelaces in case the green is too much. The material of the leopard is soft but sturdy.No complaints.": "5", "I love them very stylish and comfortable to wear for long periods of time.": "5", "I have not found a more comfortable shoe.  I had the original \"careless\" UltraBoost and I am still wearing them for all I do in the gym but wanted that same comfort on the street.  They are a little pricey for my budget (and one day I'll snag the 21s) but I couldn't resist the PP drop even if they were on a color I really didn't need.  My favorite shoe.": "5", "As an owner of a few other pairs of boost this is a great addition. Love the pattern and color way, makes for a lot of flexibility and matches with nearly everything.

I love my other Adidas shoes that were less tan half of what these cost.": "3", "Really just an amazingly comfortable shoe, and it looks fantastic. My only gripe is that it's really got a narrow opening for the foot, and it takes a good amount of force to get it on. But once it's on, the fit is great.

They are a little expensive but they are perfect for running or spending all day walking.": "5", "The shoes is fantastic looking and for the most part a great cushioned shoe, however the width was way to tight, so much so I thought I was wearing compression shoes.  Also I don't care for the sleeve style, I prefer to have my tongue and laces.": "2", "Love it I will definitely recommend to others!!!!!": "5", "Definitely recommend this shoe and it would look good on anybody": "5", "There were no flaws with the shoe when they came in. They fit me perfectly with the length and width of my foot. There were also no problems at all with the shipping service.": "5", "I hate running, but after getting these, it makes it so much easier, the fit and materials make it a lot less impactful when walking, jogging or running": "5", "The shell is super light and breathable and the energy return from the boost sole is great": "5", "The shoes are very comfortable and perfect for running. However, the plastic casing that holds the shoelaces broke after a few uses.": "4", "Out of all the knit patterns for the OG Ultra Boost this has to be the best one thus far.

You'll always catch me with these on my feet.": "5", "Highly recommend them, they make it feel as though you are walking in clouds": "5", "The shoes are super cute... they're really tight at the top, though. I am a 6.5 (W) and own the adidasboost ultraboost in the same size, which fits a lot better. Hopefully they will stretch out!": "4", "I bought this a few months back and i would get compliments every time i would wear them. It's very comfortable. I can wear it for hours and my feet doesn't feel tired and achy. It's also cute and stylish. I love it.": "5", "These fit ok.

Highly Recommend!": "5", "I think I may never purchase another type of shoe again": "5", "I own many pairs of ultra boosts and this is my favorite pair. The football blue color is gorgeous and will compliment any skin tone. The fit is true to size. It is very lightweight and the sock-like fit is amazing. My only issue is that it is extremely hard to put it on since the opening is pretty narrow and it does not stretch a lot. I am hoping with regular use it will widen up. Other than that I highly recommend this pair and greatly appreciate that it is built with some recycled materials.": "5", "Definitely still some comfy ultraboosts but not as comfy as my uncaged ones.": "4", "Ggggrrrrrreeeeeaaaaattttt sssssssshhhhhooooooeeeees": "5", "First time trying ultraboost.

PErfect balance of comfort and support.": "5", "These shoes are responsive whether going for a walk, jog, run or just meeting up with friends. I bought the sexy white on white to pair with any and all outfits for the summer. Size, width and toe box are all perfect and very comfortable.": "5", "The comfort is amazing and the greys make the shoes pop out instead of it fading away.": "5", "UB fit snug by design (like most adi-Running shoes). I am a 5-10k runner, so this is plus for me. I always go TTS or not at all. Some knits fit better than others... It's not only a look. The 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 are my favorite fitting UB knits. They feel a lot more adaptive. The 4.0 feels especially restrictive and even caused pain in my foot. I returned the only pair I ever copped and never tried them again. I never bothered with the 3.0 due to the largar ankle opening. The 19-20 are good performance updates. The 21 is the best performing UB (minus the weight). The DNA designation is a great way to try all the different OG knits for the one that fits your foot best. The DNA BOOST formulation feels amazing under foot. This particular colorway pays nice homage to the first UB and the leather for more upscale vibes.": "4", "Super comfortable and they look great I get so many compliments .

She now says she won't wear another brand": "5", "In order to have the perfect shoe order half a size up.": "5", "This colorway isn't for everyone, but it's fun and celebrates the OG era in a wild mix of hues and knit patterns. It's very cozy 'cos the \"5.0\" is a greatest hits of the knits that came before it. This approach pops in this out there multicolor. The launch heel cup and smoked translucent cage further push the concept. I'm a runner who enjoys wearing running shoes in leisure. The UB has always been a good option for recovery and rest. The DNA range is the perfect way to time capsule what must have been a surprise success.": "4", "Love the Ultraboost shoe.Extremely comfortable and nice design.": "5", "It goes with everything Adidas and beyond. My wife wants a pair": "5", "I love the collaboration with soccer teams do more like this": "5", "Feels like you're walking on trampoline literally no energy is wasted with each step": "5", "Great for running.

I absolutely love the fit and the comfort.": "5", "As someone who's been in love with the ultraboost shoe design and comfort for nearly a decade, I can confidently say that these shoes will have everything you're looking for and then some. In addition to being some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever had the pleasure of owning, the collaboration with the folks over at NASA to celebrate the launch of the Artemis program is incredible to see, and even more enjoyable to show off. Can we currently take these shoes and wear them on the surface of our moon? Maybe not today, but someday in the near future, inspired generations may very well walk the surface of celestial bodies in BOOST technology. Long story short, these are awesome, I love the design, and I hope there's more collaborations like this in the future.": "5", "I liked the material and the color. The back of the shoe is really nice.": "5", "Great colorway. Goes with practically everything and boost is super comfortable": "5", "Nice running shoe, however I recommend going up .5": "5", "I just got these running shoes for my daily 5k and 10k's and must admit that you get what you pay for.

Nice fit": "5", "I have flat feet and had a fasciotomy in May on the left foot. These shoes are excellent for when I do cardio (elliptical,  treadmill, stairs) the really do save my arches from being achy as I have completely flat feet. Oh and my crunchy knees as well. I'm 34 btw lol. So after thanks Adidas, these pricey shoes are actually worth it.": "5", "The most comfortable sneakers I ever worn ever.

Boost will be in all my shoes going forward": "5", "Little roomy but a half size down was tight. Other that that they are beautiful and comfortable.": "5", "One of the most comfortable shoes I own. The fitment is perfect.": "5", "These shoes are my favorite to train in!  Indoor and outdoor they are wonderful!": "5", "Fantastic show for working out.

Very comfortable": "5", "These shoes are great! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable running shoe.": "5", "These shoes not only look awesome due to the next gen tech in the midsoles, but they are also very comfortable and perform well. Some of the early versions of 4D's I tried were a little stiff for my liking, and not the most comfortable shoes to stand in for a long period of time, but these newer ones are definitely different. My feet feel great when wearing them. I am excited to do some more high performance activities to really put them to the test.": "5", "Great value, excellent style.Love these shoes! Can't recommend enough": "5", "I would highly recommend these to people who train at the gym and run. Never have bought black soles before but this are super unique!": "5", "Out of the many shoes i order from. Adidas on a regular basis these have been the most impressive when it comes to comfort and style. My expectation was exceeded in this case by far. Definitely love this pair": "5", "I collect Ultraboost shoes and these are great! There are more reflective details than you can see in the photo. I love the heathered look of the knit part and the shoelaces. Overall I love how tech-y these look and the fit it very comfy. True to size. I wear a women's 10 so got a men's 8": "5", "Very comfortable love the color..wish they had more colors": "5", "the black X90004D SHOES are very comfortable to workout in,  jog,  and take the normal walk with the dog. THE TREAD ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOE SEEMS VERY LOW. I HOPE THESE SHOES LAST FOR AWHILE.": "5", "I have got so many complements for this shoe. Very satisfied with the overall look and feel of this shoe.": "5", "these are great - great fit, great look - get compliments all the time, and great comfort. I walk around all day on hard floors and don't even notice that I don't want to pull them off as soon as I get home. Good for resistance training also": "5", "they fit great and everyone compliments the style.": "5", "Doesn't feel like I'm even wearing sneakers. High style factor. Super happy!": "5", "It take a bit of time to get used to them.But after that they are super comfortable.The more you walk the softer the mitsol gets.INSANE": "5", "I recommend going a full size down from normal ultra boost sizing": "5", "highly recommend these shoes, very stylish. And, finally a shoe with Oklahoma State University Colors: Orange and Grey.": "5", "Awesone design and comfort!!Awesone design and comfort!!": "5", "Great shoes but a little pricey but they wear well and the design and looks are top notch.": "4", "Shoe is runs a little big, the color way is awesome. The material is very breathable and very comfortable.": "5", "Fits a little wider in the toe which gives them a better fit for me but it does fit a little different than any of their other running shoes": "5", "They are perfect for running training since they are a little heavier than regular running shoes and ultraboost which makes them perfect for training. They were also true to size for me.": "5", "The shoes are great although I thought they would be more comfortable that the ultra boost line. They do have more support than the ultra boost but not as comfortable. I would buy these again. I am on my feet all day and they do not bother me after work. Get more color ways adidas please.": "4", "Stoked. 4D may be more comfortable than Boost. I need a little more time to see.": "5", "I bought this one with a holiday discount in last minutes. This one fit perfectly even though the size is 1/2 smaller than my preferred one and the looking is just great, very comfortable to wear": "5", "Good quality and great color and comfortable is for running": "5", "Great shoe that is so comfortable to wear.  People always comment on the style of the shoe.": "5", "Was worried about people saying the shoe is too stiff compared to boost but it is more stable cushy than boosts bouncy cushy. Does that mean it's uncomfortable? No, you guys have unrealistic expectations lmao. It's a fine shoe that is also very stylish.": "5", "I like the shoes, fit, color way and roominess. However, it is not as comfortable as I thought they would be. The ultra boost DNA that I have is much more comfortable. I stand on my feet all day for my job and I don't know if my feet will last. There is one caveat. I tried them on right after they were delivered and they were cold. So this may effect the way the shoe feels. I will update my review if it changes. Not sure if I will keep them or send them back and just get the ultra boost again.": "3", "Has some weight to it but Its a solid built shoe that should break in well and handle some run time. Quality I must say too. I love the 3D printed bottom and it doesn't give away too much where you feel off balanced. I have no complaints about this shoe. It fits perfectly too and doesn't irritate my heel as some do when built too high and tight up.": "5", "These shoes look awesome and are very comfortable.  I usually don't spend this much on shoes but decided to splurge.  Not sorry that I did": "5", "Great looking shoe style and comfort can be used to just wear also.": "5", "I would definitely recommend this sneaker its comfortable and very fashionable": "5", "These shoes fit perfectly and are very comfortable, however it took nearly a month after ordering them to finally receive them.": "5", "Okay I saw these drop months ago and were the first shoe illustrated in 360. I loved them from the start but watched & waited for a sale price. After slipping them on, I'd almost pay extra for them. The common issue for my shoe figment is toe boxes being too tight abs compression beginning where your foot is the widest. I was hopeful when reviews were placing the shoe as slightly wider than average. I can actually spread my toes out, and this is a critical for balance and recovery from a neuroma situation that developed after wearing narrow shoes that caused my fifth metatarsal to stuff under my forth. The greatest thing about this slightly roomier toe boxed shoe is that IT DOESN't look like a wide shoe. Instead they are spectacularly streamlined. I'm stoked in every aspect other than I will need more of these and they reside at the top of the pricing chart. Highly recommended for those needing %15 more tow box.": "5", "I got it for them today and they got me to pick them out for the Christmas party tomorrow at five so if you wanna I would be happy if they got it": "5", "Tongue is uncomfortable compared to ultraboosts that I have purchased .": "4", "Like the fit and the gray on them. I really like the 4d look": "5", "Look great.  I usually wear ultraboost (2018).  The recommendation to purchase these a 1/2 size down was accurate.  I'll definitely buy these again.": "5", "Beautiful and comfortable shoe. Seem to be slightly larger than all my other Adidas. Amazing technology.": "5", "I love my new adidas kicks!They are truly perfect!": "5", "This shoe is very comfy. I was debating weather I liked the x9000 4d or not, but after trying them on they looked and felt amazing! I liked these so much I'm definitely getting them in another colorway.": "5", "very cool colors and leaves your feet feeling amazing after a long day": "4", "Looks really nice. Nice quality and very comfortable.": "4", "Perfect fit and design! The support is great, and they definitely attract attention.": "5", "These are really nice looking shoes and highly reflective at night. If I was to order them again, the only thing I'd change is going a half size smaller. The look really sharp with jeans.": "5", "Good look, great fit. Decided to buy a size bigger for orthotic insole.": "5", "Great sneaker and  amazing look. I compare everything to the comfort of my ultraboost  and this shoe is fine, but not quite a boost.": "5", "Glad I purchased these! Super comfortable and great for all day on your feet.": "5", "Wore them for the 3rd time and when I went to tie them up the plastic around the top lace hole just ripped right thru": "1", "Confortable sneakers during summer months but not suitable for winter months.": "5", "100% recomiendo este zapato color d\u00edselo y comfort dar pasos gigantes una nueva sensaci\u00f3n!": "5", "all good. the grey color is a little funky.just my feeling. i like a darker grey.": "4", "Great shoe, but not as comfortable as Ultraboosts. Recommend a half size down at least.": "4", "It is a very well made shoe for running. It fits perfectly to my feet and is Very comfortable. It has a sporty and futuristic design. Colors matching is excellent: back with neon green finishes. The shoe is made very well.": "5", "Great build quality, firm but comfortable. As if I am not wearing out the compression.": "5", "I decided to upgrade from the Ultraboost series.  I tried the  X9004D.  The shoes look great.  I need extra cushioning in the heel.  And a lot of cushioning as my knees are bad.  Just using them for walks.  I found this shoe a little stiff and not that cushioning on my walks.  Otherwise I do like the fit, although they do run a drop big.  I am going back to my BOOST for my next pair.": "3", "Easy to order. Great communication during shipping. The shoes are spectacular!! I highly recommend.": "5", "Adidas has won me over. My last 4 running shoe purchases has made my comfort level exceed expectations.": "5", "Love the new kicks. Very comfortable and stylish at the same time": "5", "Beautiful design and contrast line the material super soft and modern looks.": "5", "Exactly what I expected.  Beautiful comfortable sneaker that I wear at work all day": "5", "Heel area fits a Little tighter than similar sneakers. The ride is a little bit firmer and not quite as soft as ultra boost. Style quality is through the roof": "5", "Great design, great look, and comfortable to wear!": "5", "Super light! Best running/walking shoe I've ever had. I have 3 pairs": "5", "Great fit true to size, no issues on a 16 hr shift as a nurse": "5", "Love these shoes and get a lot of looks on them. Only thing i dont like is the tongue is firm and can dig into your foot if you dont wear socks.": "5", "Comfortable, lightweight & interesting to look at!": "5", "Great shoes that work for whatever you need to pair them with. Super comfortable and expect complete strangers to ask about them": "5", "I love these tennis shoes, they are the best, I feel super comfortable with them, the design is great": "5", "What a great shoe and has some nice features. I felt vet comfortable": "5", "I have a black pair and I love it. Unfortunately, they don't carried size bellow 7 M.... very disappointed": "3", "Absolutely love these. My feet are super sensitive because I've torn my feet muscles a few times, but these provide a firm, supportive grip. Even whilst running in the gym they feel super lightweight. Just wonderful.Plus, they're gorgeous. Obsessed.": "5", "The colors are great they are super comfortableI bought them size 6.5 for men and im 7.5 women.": "5", "I love how this shoe looks and feels on foot. Pictures don't do it justice. Not as comfortable as boost but very close and makes up for it in style and aesthetic.": "5", "Very attractive and comfortable. I have recommended these shoes to many of my friends": "5", "Shoe was as appeared in images, but within the first 5 minutes of wearing my feet were miserable.": "2", "Love the show but only wore them about 10 times and the bottom is coming loose": "1", "Man I love my adidas but this one disappointed me. It gave me a blister on the top of my toe, there is a lining that runs around the lace section and thats just keeps cutting into the foot. I run with socks on but i still got a blister..never happened and I got them all ultraboost, tennis shoes. Heartbroken!": "1", "I workout in these shoes both in the gym and doing high intensity interval training outdoors (with lots of running) - these shoes are holding up the quick movements and different terrain well. Solid product.": "5", "These are some awesome shoes! Of course, they aren't as comfortable/plushy as Boost but when you break these in, they are awesome and comfy. Running, Walking or a Casual shoe. I love the 4D Aesthetic!": "5", "I have a bunch of the 4d soles.  I prefer the stiffer support they have without feeling rigid.  Great uppers.  Cool colorway, mixed materials.  Great job": "5", "I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it.": "5", "Very nice color and textile. Would recommend this to a friend": "5", "Complimented often when people see them out in public": "5", "The most amazing soul Ever. The design is amazing.": "5", "This is my 6th pair of adidas, and I just returned them. The size is way different than the rest, not comfortable, to big, and not for me. I'll be reordering soon!": "2", "I'm usually size 11-12 for every shoe I have worn but these just were too big for me. They were longer than the Ultra4D shoes I got instead even though they were both size 11. They do not fit snug for me, would have loved to keep them since the quality and design are nice.": "2", "The shoes are great and fit perfectly but one of them is a little bigger than the other, so that spoils the fit and makes it uncomfortable to wear. Looks like they manufacture the right one at one facility and the other at another. Given the price it's disappointing. I am returning them.": "1", "Highly reccomended.Just get them in half size smaller.": "5", "Normally I can't buy shoes with a one piece tongue as my feet are wide. These shoes allow for the upper to stretch and are very comfortable. These are a bit heavy compared to other running shoes but are still my favorites.": "5", "I skipped on the UB 4D's for these bc of the silhouette. After I got them and started wearing them I didn't regret my decision at all. Great casual shoe as well.": "5", "I really like these shoes. Great quality.   Fit well. If you need more lift and cushioning in the heal like Yeezy's have then you may want to consider them.": "5", "these sneakers look great and very comfortable to wear": "5", "The regular 4d WORKS with your ankles, NOT the new x90004d. They will cause you to step and roll your ankle, if you have a weak ankle that needs width support please do not get these. If you have ankle issues please just get the regular 4d because they will seriously improve your balance. Shoes looks great appearance wise but support for your ankles are not there with this one.": "3", "These are some great shoes really enjoying get lots of compliments": "5", "Feels amazing to run with these shoes and I like the design": "5", "Other than running  a bit big these shoes are really nice and comfortable... definitely would recommend them...": "5", "This shoe has it all in sense of stability and comfort.": "5", "I purchased every color of this shoe. They are very comfortable to wear. They would be perfect for running except that they are a bit too heavy for running but they are good for a nice jog around the neighborhood.  I would recommend for jogging they are just a little heavy for running for my taste.": "5", "These look really nice and they fit very comfortable but they do run a little small. I would still recommend because I really do like them.": "5", "These are extremely comfortable and stylish. I would totally recommend purchasing.": "5", "I got these out of curiosity about the 4D sole and because I thought this model and colorway looked great. I have barely taken these off since I got them. They are preposterously comfortable at true to size. The fit is performance minded, so they wrap your foot firmly but also very comfortably. The 4D sole is incredible. It is bouncy and gives and is firm and supportive right in all the right places for me. I love the softness of Boost, but I may actually prefer the more firm and supportive feel of 4D.": "5", "I love the 4D Run 1.0's. These take that 4D and combine it with a new sleek and eye catching design. Im usually a 9.5 but in the Run 1.0's I wear a 10 because I wanted more space in the forefoot. Given the knit upper, I went true to size and got a 9.5. I found there still to be ample room even if you ordered true to size. My main issue with the shoe (as someone else mentioned) is that my foot never felt secure around the ankle. The heel-tab looks sleek but lack support and does nothing to prevent the back of my foot/ankle from slipping upwards slightly with each step. It was a heartbreaker because I love the look, comfort and quality but it would irritate me to wear. Had I sized down another half size, perhaps the fit would be more secure but at the expense of a tighter toebox/forefoot.": "3", "Loved the way the shoes looked, felt and handled during my workouts! Would recommend 100% to those who run and train hard!": "5", "Everything is perfect. I love this style. But it is a little narrow.": "5", "Sick shoe dope colors and very comfy. I jist had to go a half size down fits a little big": "5", "Been using it for some light exercising like running and jump ropes. It's a bit less comfortable than Ultraboosts, but not by much and the stability when exercising is a worth it exchange. It runs a bit narrow so I went a half-size up from my normal size.": "5", "Great look and style. Made of nice material. I like the way it feels and looks": "5", "Really love this pair, the PK is so stretchy and comfortable and the 4D midsole is very responsive. Go .5 size up as the PK fits a little larger than normal. All in all , these are a great shoe for running or everyday use. I highly recommend.": "5", "Some how someway maybe adidas can combine boost and 4d. 4d is a good looking shoe but it's missing the boost comfort. Boost is a comfy shoe but missing the 4d style.": "4", "Simplistic design, very lightweight, and very yeezy'z like.": "5", "Los mejores son c\u00f3modos y suaves para los pies no hay mejor opci\u00f3n": "5", "Great shoe! Extremely supportive and comfortable. The primeknit is GREAT on this model. I am a size 11 in most Adidas. I returned the 11 in exchange for a size 10. Unless you like an extreme amount of wiggle room, I'd suggest sizing down 1/2 at least. I wear 11.5 in ultra boost and 12 in yeezy boost 350 for reference.": "5", "Dope designs, and great feel to it. So comfortable!!": "5", "amazing quality!! Would definitely recommend it to anyone": "4", "I like to wear flashy colors and these just spoke to me when I was looking. I love everything about them and I get compliments. Wear a pick or green shirt and these just compliment the whole look.": "5", "Tongue is hard. Once laced up, they are a perfect fit. Definitely a head turner.": "4", "I dont understand how they could get a shoe so close to comfortable but miss two key things. For one the tongue of the shoe is too hard and it pokes right into your foot at the bend. Second, the heel support is too low. It slides off my foot when I step. It cups your heel about a 1/2 inch too low. It's a same too because I love the look.": "2", "Best shoes that i purchase so easy to run so easy to walk and so easy to wear": "5", "Love the look of this shoe. It's one of the reasons I wanted to buy it. What gets me though is it's lack of comfort. Compared to the ultra boost, these are seriously uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. I am on my feet for 8-10 hours a day working retail so I need something that's not gonna make my feet hurt at the end of the day. Unfortunately these do. There is great cushioning around the heel on the inside. I know the ultra boost will work for me so I guess I'll go back to them.": "3", "The shoe is great. Glad all black 4D shoe has arrived.": "5", "stylish and super comfortable giving you the flexibility and fashion you want": "5", "Would recommend to anyone . Not only a good looking shoe but one of the most comfortable i have ever bought!": "5", "Very comfortable shoe super sharp have the same one in what and black that has the 4D material in green. Excellent fit": "5", "Best shoe for running and athletic performance since the '19 ultra boost. I can perform linear and multi-planar movements flawlessly with this model.  The sock liner contours and grips the way it should, the width is just right and the entire pair is lightweight.The x90004d IS half a size smaller than the 4d run; I am a sz 9 with these, a 9.5 for the 4d run and a 10.5 for ultra boosts. Also, the tongue and straps may seem obtrusive and uncomfortable at first, but it's no problem once they're adjusted.The 4d run compared to this shoe is narrower, plushy and the sock liner has too much cushion (resulting to poor grip); this last statement also makes the '20 ultra boost a poor performance model compared to its predecessor (aside from the added weight). These factors make the 4d run a nightmare to train in, forcing me to not only go half a sz bigger, but also deal with the slipping around the heel AND toe box. I will ask again - PLEASE MAKE THIS MODEL THE FUTURE OF 4D RUN PRODUCTS.": "5", "I love Adidas, and it's been my favourite shoes since I started running and I lost 30kgs just by running and always grateful. However, this shoe is very uncomfortable. The tongue tip is protruding at the base and it is rubbing into my skin (check photos) and the skin is torn/damaged. I would not recommend this to anyone unless this is mended. However, for plain walking, it was a great feeling, but if you want to run, then this is not the shoes.": "1", "I really like the size and the fit was perfect. Really recommend it": "5", "I recommend you to buy this it's so comfortable and easy to use": "5", "Super comfortable right out of the box. I ordered my normal size but it was a little big.

Highly recommended.": "5", "I stepped outside of the box this time with the color of the shoe. It actually looked even better than online. The colors pop. Great shoes! It's snug width wise but perfect for me because I have narrow feet. The side of my feet did get a lil stressed in them in the arch area when I first wore them. Not sure if it was because they needed to be broken in or what. I dnt have an arch but never had that problem with adidas shoes.": "5", "Good quality very comfortable makes running fun and my feet don't hurt as much": "5", "I purchased these after really wanting to buy the ultraboost.

All in all it's a great shoe. Comfortable & stylish. Would highly recommend.": "4", "I love the sleek style of this shoe. This shoe pairs well with any style of jeans. Perfect for all ages.": "4", "a times jordan sneakers can be a hit or miss. These sneakers are not a major hit, but just okay. They are basic and the materials are just alright. The patent leather can be tricky to maintain. After a while they will crease badly. But for the price, you can get your fun out of it and toss them.": "5", "they are pretty true to size great fit went half size up then i wear in dress shoes and was perfect fit. great soft medium gray color": "5", "love them. have all but 2 colors.of these 6 rings. hold up and last": "4", "I ordered the grey ones and was so excited for them to come in. It's a little hard to put them on, gotta really let the laces be loose, but they're comfortable once you break them in. Definitely gonna be ordering another color or two.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe, affordable, love all the 6 ring shoes my 4th purchase. Love all the colors, very pleased with this shoe.": "5", "These might be the best Jordan's out there! I think the Air Jordan 11 are amazing. But these are a mix of a few Jordan's together and they're better than the original. I got them in all black and I can't decide which ones are better. Get compliments every time I wear them. Best!": "5", "My daughter she said they are SO comfortable. All I needed to know.": "5", "I'm an avid sneaker head and these are some of my favorite. Great fit and don't make your feet too hot. Can be casual but can also be used to hoop. Overall an amazing shoe": "5", "The design is a combination of the shoes that MJ wore during his 6 NBA Championships. Hence the name, 6 Rings. The midsole and outsole are the same as on the Air Jordan 13.For me, the shoes are super comfortable. It can be a little difficult to get your foot in, but if you loosen the lace lock first you'll be fine. I remember when the 6 Rings originally released over 10 years ago. I'm going to try and get as many colors as I can because I think they look great and the fit is perfect for me.": "3", "Shoe feels weird not comfortable good style and colour tho": "5", "I've bought this shoes for my brother and he loves them!!!": "3", "I ordered the ones with navy blue.When i wear them I have to wear like really thin socks because they feel more comfortable": "2", "Had a pair of the 6rings about 5 years ago. Best bball shoe I've ever had. Then I got these...Feels like I'm being stabbed in my arch. Nothing like my old pair. Huge let down.They look sweet, like I wanted, but very uncomfortable to play in.": "4", "These are very comfortable shoes for what I need them for. The fit is right on. They are snug around the ankle and gives excellent support. The styling and color (white, blue, and black) is good for coordinating with a variety of clothes I wear. Very good shoes.": "5", "Just received my shoes today. They are extremely comfortable and our uniquely designed. These are a must get. Great purchase overall.": "5", "It looks nice and it's very comfortable.": "5", "I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY HUBBY AND HE IS IN LOVE WITH THEM... :)": "5", "Great design and color. This is my son's second pair of 6 Rings and he loves them. They are Jordans and still overpriced though.": "5", "he loves them so i love them. he says theyre super comfortable and theyre cute.": "5", "Love The Quality, The Colors, A Must Have If You Are A Jordan Fan.... Thinking Of Getting Me Another Pair!": "5", "Six Rings is a classic sneaker. Being that this shoe combines several styles of Jordans (AJ 6,7,8,11,12,13,14) you can't go wrong with buying this shoe. The elephant print really adds detail and has been a popular trend with the Jordan brand. The light blue makes way for a easy outfit matchups for spring/summer wear.Six rings are comfortable whether you're walking, playing a game of pickup or spending a day with the family.": "5", "If you are a air jordan fan you need at least on pair of these. They are very comfortable!!!": "5", "These are one of my favorite pairs of Jordans! The fit is perfect and it does a great job of combining all 6 original pairs of J's made to create one elegant and stylish pair. I own 3 pairs in multiple colors and really enjoy the look, feel and fit of them all. Don't be discouraged and get yourself a pair ASAP!": "5", "Comfortable shoe to wear and good color combination": "5", "i love the shoes especially they are warm at the bottom there really cool i like basketball shoes even though i am a tomboy they are just my kinda thing bye.": "5", "Being a fan of MJ shoes I love the idea of taking the best of each of his championship shoes and merging them into one, especially since I have yet to get my hands on a pair of 11's. As for the shoe in general, the shoe is beautiful piece of work and is made of high quality material and fits snug all around. My only complaints are like most of the retros the sole is hard and needs an insole to make it truly feel comfortable and the patent leather creases pretty easy at the toe area, but there isn't much you can do about that. Overall this is a beautiful shoe, so beautiful I am hesitant to wear them ;-)": "5", "this could be one of the best shoes of the Jordan brand": "5", "i bought these shoes for my son .He collects jordon shoes he loves the comfort and the style he has worn only jordons since he was a little and would recommend them to any one young or old": "4", "I like these more than the 11s, good quality and are comfortable.": "4", "Love the style of the 6 rings! Shoe lives up to the legend it was name after! Jordan fan for life!": "4", "The shoe is great. The only problem i have with the shoe is that if you use ankle socks, the inside lining of the shoe will scratch the back of your feet.": "5", "I am impressed with the look of this shoe! I will have to get it in a few more colores": "5", "I originally purchased these back in 2008, when they came out with the concord version, and just got the bred 6 rings. I have to say, these have been my gym shoes for 2 years now, and they look immaculate still. bottoms have yellowed with age gracefully, and they are still in great playing shape. I think these shoes saved me from 2 separate potential broken ankles, thats how great they are for performance. light weight, sleek, look good with jeans, can't go wrong here!": "5", "I absolutely love the comfort, but especially more the color schemes... Greatness": "5", "I love the shoe for my underpronation foot, I just needed more cushion for my runs. Great shoe": "4", "Great shoe, very comfortable with wide toe box. Bought to replace Nike running shoe that has a narrow toe box that were killing my feet. The ASICS shoe looks good and feels good. This is my second pair of ASICS in a month. Very pleased.": "5", "They beautiful confortable i only wish it arrive a little faster": "5", "The sneakers came quick and they are very light and comfortable definitely recommended": "5", "So this neutral to under pronation shoe and has a great fit and is light. Stability is also excellent in comparison to the Adidas Ultra Boost that I replaced. I was concerned about the drop of the DynaBlast however, what I have noticed is that my speed has increased immediately. Still early in the shoe - about 20 miles. I mix my training from a consistent time run and mixing up the amount of miles to a speed interval run on other days. The shoe has worked well with both types. Cushioning for me is spot on and I'm 5'7 at 185lbs.": "5", "Great running shoes! I was an avid runner for years but took a break now getting back into it. These shoes are the perfect first step!  Maybe not the lightest shoes in the world but have plenty of cushioning without feeling unstable.": "5", "Really love this shoes, light weight, great design": "5", "I was really disappointed in these shoes, especially after I loved the Asics prior. I have never had a more painful pair of running shoes in my life. I literally could not complete a quarter mile at times. It felt at times my ankle was about to give out. I though maybe it was an adjustment, and the pain would go away, but it does not appear to be the case. Extremely disappointed.": "1", "Great sneakers true to so size and extremely comfortable": "5", "Very nice shoes.  My son loves the colors and how light they feel!": "5", "Dynablasts have brought me back to Asics.  These fit great.  super light feeling on the feet.  Have a generous toe box...FINALLY. I've struggled to find shoes with a nice toe box.  The DynaFlyte 1 were great. but then they changed the arch and became not comfortable.  I've been very happy with these Dynablasts.  Gonna quickly buy another before something changes and I don't have a spare.": "5", "I purchased these shoes for my husband, he loves them. He is a Physician therefore, he is on his feet most of the day. \"They are very lightweight and comfortable\".": "5", "My new go to trainer. Light, breathable fresh looking upper, awesome bounce. Love love love. I've tested the Glideride, Nova Blast, Nimbus Lite, Kayano, and C\u00famulus, as this one is my favorite!": "5", "This shoe is amazing! It's light and so comfortable. Had to wait a month for this color to be back in stock. I should have ordered 3 pairs! Love the Dyna line of ASICS": "5", "Going from my old pair of nike free runs to these asics and the difference in comfort is incredible! Makes you feel like you can run forever.": "5", "not enough support very soft sole makes my foot feel unstable": "3", "Just got these in the mail and holy cow are they great! The black color is only sold online which was fine but was able to try on a pair at a local sports store for fit. They are fantastic. I wear a 12 and these fit perfectly. Ive been wearing the \"B\" brand for years and switched to the \"A\" brand. Couldn't be happier!": "5", "Great fit and style and the gel soles are very comfortable.": "5", "Great shoes! Generous cushioning while still allowing for free foot movement. I also love the looks. You can't go wrong with these!": "5", "Great shoes! walking, elliptical and they feel great!": "5", "Love this shoe it's the only one I wear when I run distance! Great for my bow legs and stride": "5", "My son actually bought this exact same pair before the start of cross country season in the fall and liked the shoe so much, we bought the exact same pair again for track season!": "5", "Very comfortable shoe. I have metatarsal problems and walk a lot. It's been pretty good so far.": "4", "I gave this 4 Stars because I Don't Necessarily Like The Thick Padding On Heel.  It's a bit thick for my comfort.": "4", "The size not good and it is very tied not comfortable": "2", "Really comfortable.  I was scared to get as I only wore the 20's but I a can't find.  There are very comfy and I wear all day at work. Will purchase again.": "5", "Best shoe....EVER!!! Always comfortable and they don't disappoint.": "5", "Feel and look great. I run 3-4 miles a day nothing crazy but my feet feel like I could run all day....": "5", "Outstanding sneaker. I needed something to address my under-pronation. These did the job. Very comfortable. I would highly recommend to those suffering from under-pronation.": "5", "The shoe is very comfortable and took a couple of days to get used to. I've upgraded from version 20, it is very similar and seems to have even better support.  It isn't water resistance so I just got the GTX version too which is as good if not better.": "5", "I love the support and feel of the road while wearing these shoes. My only issue is the toe box. It seems slightly cramped for my foot. Despite this, the rebound, traction, and strike is wonderful.": "4", "These shoes are amazing. They are comfortable, fit well and has a nice arch support for walking or running.": "5", "They are very comfortable and do not alter my performance at all. If anything I feel faster with them and I feel like they spring me off of the ground. I would recommend these.": "5", "I ordered these shoes for my son-in-law. He put them on right away and said they are the best shoes. These were his second pair": "5", "Comfortable running shoes, excellent quality, and very light.": "5", "Neutral Cushion shoe with the right amount of support": "5", "After researching shoes for under pronation, I decided to give these a try. This far good decision. They are noticeably lighter and provide more support than another pair from a manufacturer with very thick soles.The toe box on these is perfect. Usually I am concerned with too narrow but these are just fine.": "5", "Great running shoe. I run in South Fla. Mud rain cross country hot and humid.  I get a year out of these shoes.  800  to a 1000 miles.  They last. Nikes would be done in three months. Souls falling apart. ASCIS really hold up.": "5", "I have slightly wide feet & go up 1/2 a size - great fit! Love these shoes!": "5", "Fits true to size and is extremely comfortable.  I've had them a week and am very pleased with the look and feel.  If you want a bright blue, this will do the trick.": "4", "Love the color; they fit great & are very comfortable.": "5", "These shoes are lightweight, stylish, and very comfortable. They were a little tight on the foot at first, but after adjusting the laces appropriately, they fit very well.": "5", "comfortable, true to size. Seems well built. Like the appearance": "5", "About 30 miles into them bow and no problems whatsoever. Took a good 5 miles or so to loosen enough to 'fit' right and haven't changed since.Enjoy these more on hard surface because of their extremely light weight while my Nimbus do better with trail-type running.All good - highly recommend for pavement...would go for a more durable bottom for anything 'off-road' so to speak.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe perfect for walking or running.": "4", "This is the best training shoe out there. I can comfortably get 700 miles out of them and the. Use them as my mowing shoes.": "5", "I love that the Cumulus design has gone back to a closer design to the older days. The heel got looser and the shoe got lower. Thank you. I had missed my favorite shoe for a couple years.": "5", "Light and comfortable shoes. I have used Nimbus in the past, but now I am considering sticking to these ones.": "5", "Comfortable , stylish, supports knees/back , and overall very good  shoe.": "4", "Just like the Cumulus 21 the sole is rather weak and it wears off too fast while used in normal daily walking/jogging routines. The rest of the shoe is ok.": "3", "I bought these as a replacement from my previous pair which were great shoes. Same model.At first I thought they were too small, but they are really just a little tighter than my previous ones. After wearing them for a month, the fit is fine. I wear them for running, walking, and my every day shoes. All black looks awesome too. I wear them with all summer clothes and they look and feel great. Both with shorts and longer pants.": "5", "Perfectly sized , excellent amount of cushion and nice breathability": "5", "I put many miles on my ASICS running shoes because I walk every where. I like ASICS shoes because they last for a long time. I will continue to buy ASICS running into the future because of the good quality and new innovation that the company puts into its shoes.": "5", "Extremely comfortable and durable. I have 2 pairs of these and love them.": "5", "Super comfy shoes! I've gone on about four 3-4 mile runs now in them, no blisters, no instability. My feet are happy at the end of every run so far.": "5", "I am not happy with the shoe. It is very tight and runs small. I am normally a 8 1/2 in reg shoes and wear 9 to run. The 9 was really a 8 1/2.I have a small width as well and with running socks the shoe was uncomfortable.": "1", "Ran in Gel-Nimbus for decades. Needed new shoes & was impressed by Gel-Cumulus 22 reviews. Just jog/walk now at 78. Thought I could save a few dollars. Have only run in about 10 times. Impressed with the cushioning. If it holds up, I'll be staying in Cumulus.": "5", "Excellent update, so much lighter than any of its predecessors, great combination of cushion and responsiveness. Can be used for a long run or a tempo day. Only criticism is a narrow toe box, but thinner socks have solved that issue. Great price for such a versatile shoe.": "4", "Great heel support. Awesome shoes! Casual runner here, great fit and super comfy.": "5", "I've had the 21 4E for 3 years and the 22's are surprisingly better with better cushioning across my foot. Comfortable right from the moment I put them on. They're fantastic for my big feet": "5", "I usually walk about 1.5 miles every other day but this morning wearing my new GEL-CUMULUS 22 i walked about 2.5 miles. These shoes are so comfortable i just wanted to walk a little bit longer. For my health reasons that alone makes them worth the cost. I think i am going for my walks every day now": "5", "These shoes really helped. Before I couldn't even run around the block without my ankle hurting. Now it doesn't hurt at all.": "5", "Light and smooth transition - don't change a thing:)": "5", "Wow!! Best shoes I have ever bought. My kids both run a lot and they love the shoes. But leave it to me to stick to my other shoes. Now that I have them I'm hooked for life.": "5", "Have been unable to run for almost 4 years due to a knew injury. Have tried many types and brands of running shoes, all top end shoes. Now, thanks to these, I can finally go running again! Very soft and spongy on impact, but supportive enough for speed. Very dynamic shoe. They did a great job with these and they look great too!": "5", "This is my second pair of Asics, this is by far the lightest & most comfortable running shoes I've ever worn in my life.The cushions are so soft, it kinda gives your feet like a pillow.": "5", "These are comfortable. I bought a pair for work and running and love them": "5", "Great pair of shoes... needed padded running shoes given my feet.  After reading about the style and build, I ordered these ASICS to relieve that foot discomfort from running.  Not only foot relief, but also relief on my knees, hips and back.  Would recommend this shoe to anyone who loves to run, but, needs additional padding in the bottom of their shoe!": "5", "They are very comfortable and it doesn't bother me when I run like other shoes.": "5", "Comfortable and according with the expectation for running": "4", "Really great improvements while feeling the same as previous versions of this model! I love the flat laces that hold tight and don't need to be double knotted, single weave upper is also sleek.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe. Great foot support. Love the color too!!": "5", "Shoes are very comfortable I have wore them up to 12 hours with no problems, I will buy more in the future.": "5", "Wore them one time to go on a long run and the fabric tore on the left and right shoe just below the laces on the instep. Left an email to customer care and still have not heard back on how they can remedy the situation. Other than that the shoes were super comfy and true to size. I've owned numerous pairs of ASICS and genuinely love your product. Hopefully this was just a bad pair.": "2", "These are not for under pronation, in fact the outside of the heel is thicker then the inside causing my ankles to roll out even more. Very let down as there's were listed as under pronation.": "1", "We love them we work in health care and are on our feet all day so comfortable": "5", "ASICS is best I love this company they bake best out of best .": "5", "So far so good, I've run about 20 miles in these and they feel great for my feet. I am a heel striker, have high arches and supinate when I run. They cushion well and feel supportive.": "5", "The Gel Cumulus 22 is a little narrower in width than the same size (10) of another pair of ASICS, but overall still pleased with purchase.": "4", "Very comfortable. True to size. Great room in the toe box!": "5", "Good looking shoes but hard on the feet. Would definitely spend the extra money for a better model or buy a completely different brand altogether. Less than a middle of the road running shoe.": "2", "I just started running again and am working my mileage up. These shoes are very comfortable and fit true to size.": "5", "Fit well, comfortable, light, good styling, great for the road": "5", "These are some amazingly comfortable running shoes!": "5", "I wear these for work, in which I am walking and on my feet 8+ hrs a day and my feet feel comfortable all day.": "5", "Love the all black shoes. Very comfortable, true to size, plenty of support and cushion. I bought two because I like these so much.": "5", "Finally Asics started to make these shoes in a decent color again. I love the solid black color. These shoes are the most comfortable running shoe for me and help with my under pronation/ supination": "5", "Very comfortable sneaker, ASICS run small so would recommend anyone that has not bought them before to go 1/2 size larger.": "4", "A very comfortable shoe. I'm on my feet all day at the hospital and this shoe makes me feel like I have a spring in my step. Thinking about getting another pair because I like them so much. Highly recommend.": "5", "Purchased as a father's day gift. My husband has always had pain in his heels when he runs but had trouble finding shoes that supported his feet while also didn't weigh him down. He loves these!": "5", "I'm 5 runs (~30 miles) in these shoes so far and absolutely love them. The white/black/green pops and look great. They are the perfect blend of cushion/support while also feeling very lightweight. I wear a 12 in most brands and this fit true to size for me. Will definitely be buying another pair.": "5", "This is my first pair of Asics in about 10 years, and I am very pleased.  The Cumulus 22 provides a nice cushioned ride but doesn't feel to mushy under your heel.  I think anyone who enjoys a neutral cushioned trainer will get a lot of mileage from these.  The upper and toebox are roomy and light.  Overall, this a really great light, solid, and cushioned shoe that feels soft without being a marshmallow.": "5", "I ran in them for the first time this morning.  They are very comfortable!": "5", "It's like running on clouds. These shoes have worked great!": "5", "Quality show, fits my foot perfect.  Shipment was delivered on time.": "5", "Very comfortable and don't hurt my feet. Would definitely buy another pair.": "5", "Solid daily runner, not a lot of cushioning for longer road runs at 220 lbs.": "4", "These shoes are great for walking. Really helps cushion your foot falls when you have bad knees. Unfortunately i had to go up half a size than i normally wear in Asics.": "4", "Like walking/running on clouds. I wish I would have gotten a half-size bigger than normal but still very comfortable.": "5", "Florida runner. Comfortable, lightweight, breathable mesh upper perfect for hot weather. Not a support shoe. Miami fan love the colorway :)": "5", "Had a blister on my right pad and my left arch hurt the first few runs. However, the break-in period was only about 5 runs or so.": "4", "Asics Gel Cumulus is a great shoe: great fit, great cushioning, really good mesh, and nice colors. It's a perfect shoe for jogging and distance running.": "5", "I don't run anymore but walk an average of 18 miles per week. Excellent stable shoe both on road an off. By far the best ASICS shoe for mr, and definitely better than all the other brands I have worn.": "5", "I have both the Gel Nimbus 22 and Cumulus 22. I prefer the cumulus. More light weight and flexible. I bought the Nimbus in a 10.5 and the cumulus in 11. The cumulus is narrow so definitely worth that extra .5 size up!": "5", "The 22's are absolutely stellar! They are the perfect mold for my high arches and have noticeably more cushioning for shock absorption and plenty of support for the heel and ankle. These shoes will eat up the miles while making you feel like you're running above the clouds!": "5", "Very strong material and comfortable shoes.  The shoes are extremely light as well, a great feel.": "5", "Light, soft on heel strike, holding up fine after 30 miles": "5", "Great everyday running shoe ...very comfortable fit.": "5", "Amazing shoe. I had the previous version. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I only have 54 miles on them so it's too early to tell.": "4", "Just bought these and so far I am loving them! Extremely comfortable and true to my normal size. Very happy with them.": "5", "Like running a cloud, not that I've ever done that but it's what I imagine it would be": "5", "Quality is high.  Shoes are comfortable and provide excellent support.  I recommend this shoe for those who run or walk for exercise.": "5", "I've been running for about two weeks with these shoes and I have never been more in love with them. They're soft on impact and I get so much support on my long runs. Definitely recommend them.": "5", "Amazing shoe. Looks great, ridiculously comfortable. No knee pain, ankle pain, or achilles pain, very supportive.": "5", "What I like best about this shoe is its simplicity. A good running shoe should not feel like an overly-engineered piece of equipment that you're strapping to each foot before heading out the door. Rather, it should be so unobtrusive that it fades effortlessly into the background for the duration of your miles. The Cumulus 22 is that shoe. It fits true to size. It's comfortable. It's durable. It's a versatile shoe that can handle a myriad of different types of runs very well. Most importantly, it's a really fun shoe to run in and one that I reach for again and again.": "5", "Last asics shoe I had was a completely discontinued style but I'm loving these!": "5", "Great fit. Unbelievable comfortable and feels really good with each stride.": "5", "The bottom tread is already wearing down, after only 10 days!  Long time Asics customer but usually with GT 1000 style.  Took the online quiz and Asics recommended Gel Cumulus, figured I'd give it a try.  So disappointed!": "3", "The shoes took a bit longer to break in than I would have thought.  Still have a bit of hotspot under ball of foot but expect it to go away.  Reasonably light.  Seem durable but only have 5 runs in so far": "4", "These have been a huge disappointment. I've been running in ASICS for 20+ years and these are the first I've had issue with. The fit feels significantly different from the cumulus 20. Comfortable for walking but a few miles into a run causing significant foot pain.  If I was able to return these I would.": "2", "I ordered a size 11 but it appears the real size of the shoe is a 10, it runs small": "1", "Fantastic shoe.  I had switched to Brooks and it just did feel right after a long run.  I went back to my standrd - the Cumulus - had no problem.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe right out of the box. Highly recommended": "5", "Great shoe from the box to my feet ,took them out for a 6mi run ,no breaking in need .Been training in these for 15yrs .": "5", "Extremely comfortable at first wear.  I don't know how they will hold up yet, but I am optimistic.": "4", "This shoe is extremely light and supportive, it's also very attractive, thank you for finally listening to athletes that want a supportive shoe, Asics used to be one of my favorite go to shoes as an ex-track runner. But you guys got away from true support, but you came back outstanding, will be purchasing more keep up the good work !!!!! Asics Gel": "5", "The shoe has good heel support and cushion. Also it's very light.": "5", "I had been wearing the Gel-Cumulus 20 and put 1,000 miles walking without any breakdown of the interior of the shoes, absolutely none. I wear a special inserts for my feet as I have type 2 diabetes. My new 22's felt like they belonged on my feet from the first step.": "5", "Shoes are not wide enough for my foot with a bunion. Wrote to ASICS about it and didn't hear back.": "3", "Best update for 2020! Smooth, light, responsive, and had a superb fit.": "5", "I have been hoping that the Cumulus would come back to form with a softer underfoot feel, more flexible forefoot and better fit. I'm happy to say that all of these things have been addressed, and it's lighter to boot!": "5", "I'm extremely pleased with the Kayano 27.  Its the perfect running shoe for me.  The fit is excellent, the weight is just right and its just an overall comfortable shoe.  I like the 27 so well I now have 3 pairs that I'm rotating in my running/training routine.": "5", "Quality product, great fit, great foot support, look great!": "5", "Perfect like every other Kayano I have owned.  Great fit and comfort.": "5", "These are wonderful shoes. They are warranty replacements and I have only worn them once. But they fit perfectly even with orthotic insoles. ASICS was very helpful and generous with the warranty transaction on a different  pair.": "5", "My husband love this tennis shoes. They are confortable.He love this shoes.": "5", "Gel-Kayano 27 has what I like.  It has a little support and has a great ride.": "5", "Great shoe. Comfy, for 12 hour shifts on my feet. Not as comfy as the Nimbus lite 2 or Nimbus 23 from asics, but still 5 star": "5", "Love the look and feel of the shoe.  I have the 26 as well but these have taken over for running.": "5", "Light weight responsive runner. Excellent for 50-60km per week running.": "5", "Excellent shoe, we're totally recommend to all friends and family. Can't wait to purchase my next pair of them, until then I'll be enjoying the ones I have.": "5", "Terrible shoe - Not the same as the Nimbus & NovaBlast": "1", "not to squishy not too firm. great for the longer runs! great for those looking for max stability. put 400 miles on my last pair run": "5", "I'm an ASICS guy. Always will be.Over 30 years, I have only had 2 complaints and both were resolved appropriately.Love this shoe. If you ever need someone to try them out, I'd love to be involved.Thank you.Brian O'Riordan": "5", "I love this brand and style for running long distance and the shoes are incredible. However, I just bought the new Gel-Kayano 27 and have had a horrible experience. I ran in then for a few days to break them in, and they have been causing me lots of pain when I run, they feel like I'm running with no support, and need to return them.": "1", "Amazingly comfortable supportive shoe for long distances. It has helped support my flat feet better than any other shoe I've owned.": "5", "My 5th pair of Gel-Kayanos. Two yellow, two blue and now black with red and white accents. A new pair restores the bounce in my step. I feel 10 pounds lighter when I put them on.": "5", "Hello everyone,As of today, I have been running in Asics for the last three almost four years. This will be my third pair of this model. As a consistent and dedicated runner, I must say Asics is my go-to brand for running shoes. I cannot stress it enough, I LOVE RUNNING in Asics. I have flat feet. Hammer toes. My feet have gone through hell and back. My feet are delicate. I have gone through more pairs I care to admit.I've tried the following brands: Nike's, New Balance, Puma, Reebok, and  Adidas.When I tried Asics a few years ago, almost all of my running injuries went away. No more knee pain, no more shin splints, my IT band pain actually improved. It only ever hurts or gets irritated if I fail to stretch or if I'm over training. Running shoes will make or break your running experience people. Invest, I REPEAT INVEST in a solid, durable, and most importantly, comfortable pair. Your feet will thank you.My absolute favorite model for my feet is the Gel Kayanos. I've owned and used two previous models. I highly recommend them!": "5", "You get what you pay for.  Every time I think Kayano's are priced a bit too high, it only takes one or two runs in another brand of shoes to make me regret not sticking with Kayanos.  Awesome shoe for someone like me that only averages 20-25 miles a week.": "5", "Since KAYANO 19 until the 27.This series are so good for running.I prefer ASICS more than nike.": "5", "Great fit, Quality material and design. I have been wearing ASICS for the past 12-15 years and kayano 27 is outstanding.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe overall good quality shoe. Good selection and prompt service": "5", "I have an issue with the front of the shoe.    The inside has a plastic material that is about .5\" high inside that wraps all the way around your foot.  Seems to be there to keep the material from falling down is all i can think.   This piece is now bending at the bend point into my big toe on both feet, and I can only assume will get worse or finally crack.    I wore them 2x to the gym and after both toes are tender.     Seems like a bad design.": "2", "This running shoe are the best runners I have ever bought.  I have very narrow, very flat feet and this running shoe is so solid and supportive I feel like I could walk and run for miles.   There is also a lot of room to wiggle your toes, and yes at 60 years old I also have a bunion and hammer toe on my left foot, yikes, and my left foot is wonderfully comfortable.  LOVE them!!!!": "5", "Great shoe. I am more of a distance walker than a runner.": "5", "These shoes are the best with prime performance. Must buy for sure!": "5", "Keeps with the kayano tradition of first class shoes": "5", "Very comfortable and great arch support. Feet feel fine even after 12 hours of work!": "5", "I never used to wear great sneakers as a teenager or adult until my wife had us go to a running store because she always wore really good sneakers. At the running store they looked at how I ran and had me try the asics kayano brand of shoe. I havent used a different brand or model of shoe since, its been 8 years now. I have neither narrow or wide feet and these always feel great!  I would highly recommend these shoes.": "5", "I love this shoe.  I am an over pronator so this shoe is a life saver.   I can run further and faster without having my feet hurting or cramping.": "5", "Stylish and roomy.  Great for casual wear.   Good fit light running.": "4", "This product is very good and the gel is perfect for my knee pain.": "5", "I've been wearing Kayanos for over 10 years. These are yet another nice iteration in the line. I like the extra room in the toe box compared to the Kayano 26. Cushioning and support work great for me as someone who logs high miles and has a tendency to overpronate.": "5", "Awesome fit and feel. Also a awesome company who made right with flawed Gel-Kayno 26 shoes.I have wore ASICS for over 10 years.": "5", "Nice shoe, useto wear them all the time. Not sure what happend with manufaturing, shoe just doesn't feel the same, left foot hurt towards the end of my shift. Sad loved Asics.": "2", "Terrible quality. They crease at the toe and are very uncomfortable / unwearable as a result.": "1", "The fit is perfect to size. A balance between good cushion and a solid feel of the ground.Super stable support for all but especially a heavier body.": "5", "Show has some heal slippage but overall comfortable fit.": "4", "Too much lace bite! At the top of the shoe. No matter what holes i use.": "2", "Excellent upgrade from previous versions, however the angle felt a bit loose.": "5", "They not bad I just wish they have more cushion in them.": "3", "Very comfortable and supportive.  On my feet 12 hours and these are the best!": "5", "I love this shoe, it so comfortable. I was having issues with my arch hurting when I would workout or run and now that I am using these shoes that has stopped.": "5", "Perfect fit! True to size and beyond comfortable to run in on pavement for 3-5 mile runs": "5", "flexible plastic in toe creases and puts pressure and causes pain on big toe. Do no buy.": "1", "Good show, nice and light but not as much stability as I would hope. Would consider it more of a neutral shoe (that's just my personal feet talking)": "4", "I like the room in the toe box and the cushioning is just right.  However the material used inside lining the heal area is too clingy and snags the cloth off my socks and builds up with balls of cloth.  Ultimately this usually leads to the material ripping and making the shoe prematurely wear.  I do not have this issue with other brands.": "3", "I have 6 pairs of 27s now. The wear pattern is right in the center of my foot.  Past models were more diagonal cutting from the outside of my heal to my big toe.  Either my stride is getting more efficient or the shoe is even better at stability than past models.": "4", "Poorly constructed. The toe box collapses and digs into toes. Unwearable": "1", "Great looking shoe, but it hurts the outside of my right foot after about 5 minutes of being on my feet. Bought as a running shoe, but will just use as a casual shoe.": "3", "Great cushion and support. Toe box is roomy. Good looking shoe. True to size.": "5", "Not as comfortable as the GEL-KAYANO 26 - pinches my baby toes": "3", "Great support and comfort. Shoe strings are never too long either.": "5", "Great fit and comfort. I've been wearing ASICS for years and they are as great as ever. My only suggestion for improvement would to have the option of tieless stretch laces. This would improve the ease and speed of prep prior to my workout.": "5", "Feel great! I have only worked out twice in them, but so far so good!": "5", "I bought these in late July of last year and immediately fell in love. My first pair of Asics. I have foot issues and these have been a practical miracle. My only complaint is that they started to fall apart fairly quickly. I tear in the fabric on the part where your foot slides in, but on the side not the back. The first lining of the sole started coming off last month and the treads are really worn down. I don't know if this is normal wear within 4-5 months or not but I'm leery to buy another pair. I had hoped not to replace them before the normal 6 months. I talked to a shoe store employee and he said that's unusual for Asics. Anyways, I do recommend them.": "4", "Never had a shoes so comfortable as this... Absolutely comfortable.. Planning  to buy again of you are ready to give a discount... Not very happy about tje color combination.. My online expectations about color didnot match.. But quality and comfort  is just amazing . i am healrh care worker and this shoes is really making me to move faster with comfort and shin pain vanished": "5", "Fits great, lots of cushion and good for my low arch food and landing pattern": "5", "Super supportive and comfortable. and looks good to boot. Already ordered a second pair.": "4", "Overall the Kayano series is consistent, my main point for improvement is the lacing system. It takes awhile to figure out how to lace them to optimize comfort.": "4", "I love the shoe except for the fact that I can see so much of the glue used on the back parts of both of the shoes that I will be returning them to hopefully receive a pair that doesn't show glue. If it does I think I'll just return them again and go elsewhere.": "3", "The shoes are too feminine for me. The light gray and if you want to call it orange. I'm not a fan of the color combo.": "4", "My husband's words when he put on these shoes was, \"Thank you, these are so comfortable!\"": "5", "I bought this a month ago and to replace my 20th Anniversary addition. Much has improved and the cushion is lighter and the forefoot make a forward motion that had to get use to . I had ran  with version 11, and 20th heavier than the flyform now being used.": "4", "Love this shoe. Switched from the DS trainer for better over-pronation support and couldn't be happier. Will definitely be buying more.": "5", "great for running or lifting weights. good support throughout foot.": "5", "Light-weight and breathable as expected.  What I don't like is the front toe area - it's not very pliable/stretchy, and it almost causes a hard crease that is not comfortable like the rest of the shoe.  Happier with some of the prior versions of this shoe": "3", "The shoe was nice, but its too narrow for my foot. It would be nice if they offered a wide version. I returned my shoe after trying them on.": "3", "Stability is great for this version of the GEL-KAYANO": "5", "Great shoe for great runs. Sturdy and very comfortable.": "5", "I wouldn't consider myself a runner, but I truly love these shoes! I am very much a \"flat foot\" individual and always struggled to find the right shoe to not cause pain. My job requires me to be on my feet routinely and these are great for long days, long walks, and occasional al runs.": "5", "At first they were uncomfortable for me. After a week of stepping them in they feel amazing and even better than the 26's. Stick true to size": "5", "These are good shoes but fit tighter than my previous Kayano's.": "4", "I am not someone who \"breaks in\" shoes; if they don't feel perfect when I try them on I do not purchase them. I have 5 pins in one foot (which caused it to spread out), and bunions and arthritis in both. These shoes, recommended by my podiatrist for motion control, felt unbelievably cushiony. It is hard to believe they are so stable. Please know that I am a 66 year old woman (size 9 Wide) who purchased this men's (regular width) version in size 7.5 and they fit perfectly! I am not a runner but I walk 10,000+ steps a day. These shoes were perfect to wear post-surgery. Thank you Asics! (NOTE: this review was initially posted for the Gel-Kayano 26 which I also purchased but returned when I tried on the Gel-Kayano 27. The 27 fit a bit snugger on my narrow-ish heel.)": "5", "FANTASTIC!First big run got me some blisters but they're a great improvement on the 26, lighter, stronger...great.": "5", "durable, stable, and lighter than ever before. this is also a great shoe for the trails": "5", "These are perfect for walking/running. Very comfortable and provide enough support for your feet.": "5", "I purchased this pair for my fianc\u00e9 as a surprise. He loves them and they are perfect for our boot camp workout sessions. The shoes arrived at a time when he told me that he wanted a pair of new ones. I was already two steps ahead.  They are a great fit and seem true to size.": "5", "The fit is great! Snug, but not too tight. Plenty of room in toe box for splay. Cushion is good, but not too soft. Energy return good too.": "5", "First of all these are very sleek looking. I was drawn to the navy/silver colorway!Looks aside, these are everything you want in a running shoe. I love the stability. I've definitively already planted my feet in awkward ways which would've destroyed my ankles -- I attribute my safety to these shoes. They're not the lightest running shoe out there but I'm not looking to run 5-min miles either. Also initially they're a little tight but once they're broken in a bit they're TTS (true-to-size). Solid build, cushiony on the back of my foot, ankle stability and helps cushion my over-pronated stride. Love these!": "5", "Really comfortable for run and cross training. I hope the tips stay in tact as my previous favorite ASICS ripped on top left top after 3 months of use.": "4", "Every Asic since the 20 has declined in quality as it's features were moved to the 250.00 Metarun. The Kayano's now are one of the cheapest made shoes. It's not real AHAR anymore only in the Metarun, no true guidance and heavy duty foot strike plate anymore all moved to the the Metarun. Todays Kayano's are terrible quality 160.00 doesn't buy much with Asic. you have to hit that 250.00 price tier today. I never thought I would have a negative thing to say about Asics now all I have is negatives.": "1", "I've run in all 27 Kayano shoes.....these are by far the best (not all the the new models were an improvement). My feet are pain free, blister free and loving the 27.It's a very high mileage shoe (I'm a ten mile a day 70 mile a week freak). I have yet to break down the upper on any of the half Duden Kayano 27s I bought this year.....but the good news is they make great casual shoes after the soles are run off.": "5", "Great feel and look. Most comfortable shoes ever. I own 4 pairs of Kayanos": "5", "These are my Third ASCIS Kayano Series of Shoes in the past 5 years. Absolutely great shoes and comforting for my feet as I have Plantar issues.  I can run on treadmill or jog outside.": "5", "Best shoes ever purchased! Best cushion soft heel!": "5", "Love the shoe.  Comfortable beyond compare!  Will likely buy another pair.": "5", "Thank you for making, and keeping, ASICS one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  This is my 4th pair of ASICS and this pair, as well as the 1st pair, is the only brand I've had that I didn't have to buy new/additional inserts to get the comfort I needed.": "5", "Very comfortable, lots of shock absorption, looks sportier in person": "5", "Unfortunately, these shoes have a weak toe cap that folds inward, rubbing my toes.  I thought it was just my pair, but when I went to the store to exchange them, I saw it was the happening with the display shoes as well.  Too bad, because they were otherwise very comfortable.  I bought the Gel-Kayano 26 instead, and that one has a stronger toe cap.": "2", "Great work shoe, I like plush shoes for running. I recommend the evoride series": "5", "This is my second pair and doesn't seem to last long before I wear them out. I walk and do not run anymore and I am wearing out my shoes in 3 months.": "3", "Material quality seems like it has gone down hill, starting to wear in spots where the Kayano-26 did not.": "2", "Most comfortable pair of Gel Kayano's I have ever owed! Would be nice if they were a tad more breathable, but comfort more than makes up for it.": "5", "Love the Kayano 27. It is very well cushioned and has a good fit. The style is nice.": "5", "A number of sires talked about the Kayano as a good shoe for stability and motion control (both of which I need big time), but they didn't work for me. I will have to try something else. Unfortunate, I was really hoping these would do the trick. Expensive mistake.": "1", "Great even if you are a NEUTRAL RUNNER. It is very cushy like my Nimbus but the extra support is nice. I alternate between the two on my daily three mike walks.": "5", "Love the cushions on this shoes. It is so comfortable when running.": "5", "Wasn't very comfy or nice to wear. Didn't enjoy it": "1", "After the first run with the shoes the plastic around the tip of the shoe starting folding inward causing pain and blisters. NOT satisfied.": "1", "These are the most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned. I use them for boot camp style/HIIT classes too. Love them!": "5", "I love having these on my feet. Very comfortable and stylish, worth every penny.": "5", "This was a completely different size than the same size I had in the same shoe last time. Had to return because it just didn't fit": "1", "I've always used shoes from another brands for running, but thought I should give Asics a try. Not sure if it's this model specifically or the styles of shoes overall, but it feels too short and loose around the ankles, and that's giving me pain/cramps on the top muscles of the feet\u2014specially when I do steep curves during running. The cushioning is great, but overall it hasn't been the best option to me.": "3", "they are as comfortable a shoe anyone could ask for. o bought this model 7 years ago and was so impressed I came back for the current model. wont take as long the next time.": "5", "Smooth, relatively lightweight, and good cushioning.  I've enjoyed running in these so far.": "5", "Love these shoes. I have two pairs and a previous version. I refuse to wear any others. Combined with a shoe insert they are unbeatable.David": "5", "No aches at all wearing them for the first time yesterday! Bye bye achy feet! #AsicsKayanosMatter#": "5", "My friend recommended these shoes since I started running a lot. Never had a problem with my other shoes but thought this would improve my running since I have almost flat feet. Went with the recommendation on the site. This is the first pair of shoes ever that have given me problems. First run gave me blisters on both of my feet where my arch is supposed to be. Shin splints and sore knees are another problem I didn't have before. Really had high hopes for these shoes. Your experience may be different but that's how mine was.": "1", "I bought these for my husband. He is an avid  runner and this is the third time he had asked me to get them for him. So he must really like them.": "5", "I've owned the 21, 22, 23 and 24 Kayano models. I wear a woman's 8.5 but switched to a men's size 7 standard width because of the less bold colors. I have narrow heels and wider at the toes. NOT bad duck feet. These are the most comfortable gym shoes I've ever owned. I do not run, only treadmill or gym classes.  Please note I use the Spenco Red walker runner insole size 2 or the green Superfeet insole recently change to Superfeet size D.  I have high arches.": "5", "Would love to see better color options for the price.  My son has this style as recommended by PT.  Maybe younger designers and deeper discounts.": "3", "They fit a little long. The arch support is amazing and my feet, ankles, and knees feel well supported. I'm a treadmill runner so I still have not figured out my shin splint problem but I'm hoping these shoes slowly alleviate that pain. After 1 month, shin pain is still prevalent.": "4", "Outstanding pair of shoes.  Very comfortable and hold up well over the miles!": "5", "Great for my tendon.  I am using in house, and have another Gel for outside house.": "5", "More padded than Kayano 26....great stability running shoe": "5", "I never understood what runners meant by \"ride\" when describing a shoe.  Now I do.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have.  I use it on my faster runs.": "5", "I love these shoes. I think they are a big upgrade on the 26 iteration in terms of feel.": "5", "In my opinion, the new Kayanos are a downgrade in comfort. They are sorely lacking in cushioning at the front. I feel small pains appear in the front of my foot after 10km. The front of the shoe gives the feeling of running with sandals. I bought these Kayanos to replace my Kayano 21, which to me were the benchmark in terms of comfort and durability. Gel front and back and barely heavier. Today the Kayano has become a minimalistic shoe. The Kayano 21s from 5 years ago as well as each of my Trabucos are more comfortable than these ... Another point, they are much wider at the front so if you have thinner feet you risk floating down there. I am very disappointed and don't understand the positive comments of other customers. I was a Asics fan. Now I am thinking of looking elsewhere.": "1", "Super comfortable, mold to your feet immediately, and they are great for walking.": "5", "I started with the Kayano 25s. And this pair of 27s did not disappoint. They feel better and I am super content with this purchase. Definitely staying in the Kayano community.": "5", "I've worn Gel-Kayano for years but had to return these due to poor quality.": "1", "I'm a life time runner who is still getting out of bed early, lacing up the Kayano's and heading out for my daily run. At age 64 and at least 100 pairs of ASICS later, I would not change a thing. Best and only running shoes I'll ever buy.": "5", "Returned. Hadnt glue pieces hanging out from parts of the shoes. Felt it was returned by someone else. Or maybe they didnt so proper quality checks once it was manufactured.": "1", "I've been a hard core fan of Asics Kayano size generation 19 - the shoe has always offered top notch stability and cushioning. Kayano 27 is not as stable as prior versions of the shoe. After I noticed that I looked at the foam on the medial side. The medial foam is softer than previous versions of the shoe. Please bring back the old Duomax foam - previous versions of the shoe felt stable and cushioned. This one feels cushioned but lacks stability.": "3", "Great true size fit, comfortable gel support, great colors accent Black base.": "5", "These shoes are not as comfortable as i was hoping. I have a pair of the new gel nimbus and these shoes are not near as comfortable.": "3", "Took a while to get them broke in but after very comfortable": "4", "Solid design and fit. Best athletic shoe and aesthetic": "5", "Great balance between cushion and support. They are great for those with plantar fasciitis.": "5", "I've at least tried on or purchased all of the last 10 editions of this shoe.  The upper is the most comfortable and secure of any.  Feels very light for Kayano.  Heel-toe offset feels low.  The only improvement I can think of would be more cushion in the forefoot.  Great running shoe.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe and provides good support.  I have been training with the Gel-Kayano for several years and they have been a strong and dependable shoe.": "5", "I have given a bad review to this shoe before but after using the shoe for over a month I have found it super awesome. It helps me to walk and run like Pro. It's an amazing quality shoes.": "5", "Toe box inside shoe hard and has a bend in it. Bites into first toe! Very uncomfortable": "1", "I am a mild over pronator and this shoes give me great support. Very comfortable, for me they ran a bit large, I went down to a 10.5 when I normally wear size 11. the inside of the front of the shoe needs to be reinforced, after two months of light walking and jogging they are starting to wear off and I can see a small hole in the the front upper mesh.": "4", "Absolutely perfect for long runs. Before my KAYANOs  my toes would get numb on a six miles run - now I feel nothing but bounce...": "5", "Great support for high arches! Great when standing on your feet for long times.": "5", "Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. They are extremely comfortable and definitely worth the money.": "5", "I am a bigger guy and am on my feet a lot as a healthcare worker and trainer.  I tried several different shoes from other companies, but my feet always hurt.  My wife loves running in Asics and convinced me to try them with your healthcare worker incentive.  They are great!  So much more support than my previous shoes.": "5", "Excellent shoe, but ankle cushion lining wears rapidly": "4", "When I first tried a Kayano, I was in love. Their 4E fit was perfect for my thick and flat feet. I had some of the best jogs in them and felt fine after long distances. This is the first time ever that a Kayano has given me the worst shin splints as they squeeze my feet. I use lock laces and have them on pretty loose but the shoe still squeezes me tight. They must have made them smaller this time. This really sucks because now I feel I can't trust the engineering anymore. I most likely won't go for the Kayano 28 and on and will probably just end up taking my bussiness to Saucony or something.": "3", "The ASICS emblem on both of my shoes are peeling off after 1 wear, I emailed asics and they have not responded back to me after two weeks. 0/10 do not recommend.": "5", "Im a nurse and I use these for 12 hr shifts at the hospital and man have they made a difference! No more sore feet after work. Thanks ASICS for taking care of healthcare workers!": "5", "The interior sole fabric started coming apart/developed holes after only 2-3 wears. Comfortable otherwise.": "4", "The shoes are real comfortable and well built. I've had them for about a month and I highly recommend them.": "5", "The shoes are comfy and sturdy.   Disappointed a bit in the color; online it looks a lighter blue---in person, it is a very deep navy, almost black.": "4", "Fit is a bit different from the 26, but overall positive corrections to my gate.": "5", "I've been buying Gel Kayanos since the 20s. Every year I get new ones. This year I'll need to buy another pair of 27 as I've greatly increased my walking distances. I used to run but now I ruck with 20 lbs and these are great for either. I love them so much I even wear them to work. I know they're not a sexy sneaker in the classic sense but the way they virtually eliminate the pain from my flat feet makes it worth it. And in a way their function brings a degree of sexiness to them. Will buy these till I die.": "5", "Great comfortable shoe. Great for arch support. Highly recommend": "5", "Very uncomfortable running shoe.. unsatisfied customer here!": "1", "These shoes are really comfortable. For someone who pronates a lot when they land they seem to keep me happy for my long distant runs. I run in Florida at the hottest time in the day, these shoes have done their job so far after 78 miles in under 2 months.": "5", "Very comfortable, excellent workout shoe, great fit.": "4", "Just like previous ASICS running shoes I have used over the last decade, this pair fits very well and provides superb support for my feet. My previous pair of a different style wore out very quickly, so hopefully time will tell if this pair of shoes will live up to the high quality I've traditionally gotten from previous ASICS shoes (the last pair excepted).": "4", "Very comfortable shoe.  Used to be a Nike guy, but will never go back!": "5", "I have been waiting for years for ASICS to come out with an all white pair of running shoes in my prayers have now been answered. I love them so much! All the comfort of their Best you and now they look slick!": "5", "I really like this shoes and i have been a purchaser of Asics for the last 6 year. But the shoes already breaking down and there are tears on the seams of the shoes. I have no idea how but it 's already wearing down.": "3", "Well made very light and feel great.Good job Asics": "5", "They're awesome.  No shin splints since I broke them in": "5", "I was so excited after buying this expansive pair of shoes. But these pair of shoes disappointed me so so much. They look good but not comfortable.": "1", "Sneaker's  that are aesthetically designed and assist in excelling at individual performance.": "5", "Helped relieve my plantar fasciitis. Toe box is big. Good shoes.": "5", "Really comfortable with firm sole and great color and design. I would recommend this for people with flat feet": "5", "I like the sneakers because they're comfortable and nice. But one negative thing is I only had the sneakers for little over a month and the bottom is already worn down a lot and probably need to replace soon.": "3", "Excellent support and cushioning with an improved tongue and heel support": "5", "I like it! Very comfortable!! I enjoy and recommend !": "5", "Best performance for running and all day wearing.  Extra cushion for longer run .": "5", "Great cushioning! Just perfect! Highly recommend! Great arch support. Lightweight compared to previous Kayanos.": "5", "I am a basketball referee and I use these shoes for that purpose. The 27s are not a good as the 26s, for me. I will be ordering another pair of the 26s for my upcoming season for sure.": "4", "Cool design and is extremely comfortable and very supportive": "5", "These shoes are AMAZING!!!  I am on my feet 12-16 hours a day and these provide excellent support and comfort!!!  You will not be sorry when you buy these!!!  Well worth the money!!!": "5", "These shoes are the most comfortable and cutest shoes I own! I'm on my feet a lot for work, and I must say, I am very impressed. I like how they hug my feet, and provides a sturdy and firm foundation, which is essential and helpful for my plantar fasciitis! Actually, since wearing these, it has helped my feet tremendously! I'm in love!": "5", "I'm a firefighter so I need shoes that are durable, comfortable and can easily take off in a rush. These hit all three marks. 10/10 will buy again.": "5", "The best sneakers to work. After 8.5 hours of walking my feet are painless and relaxing.": "5", "Perfect fit, perfect support, perfect shock absorption": "5", "Love these shoes, very form fitting to my foot and especially arc while still being light and conforming.": "5", "Came back to the Kayano after 10 years, was always chasing the fit and comfort of my '02s.  I'm flat footed and weigh 190lbs, I could feel the difference in comfort immediately.  All pluses for me with this newest model.": "5", "I actually ordered both the Keyano 27 and the Nimbus 22.  Both felt great on my feet, they just felt different from each other.  I decided to keep the Nimbus which just seemed to fit my high arches a tad better.  It was a hard choice though as either would have worked well.": "5", "So light...these are my new favorite version of all time Kayano's...second pair is on the way already.": "5", "This shoe got it right this time. Comfortable from the minute I put it on. Different that the previous models that had some areas of discomfort.": "5", "Well rounded for all levels of physical activity!!": "5", "A little heavier than I expected. Overall would recommend.": "4", "Great, I love these shoes. Very comfortable and nice looking!!!": "5", "Excellent fit and comfort. Early to tell but quality also seems very good. Size runs true. Super lightweight and cushioning is outstanding.": "5", "Excellent for over pronation and relief of back and leg pain when running.": "5", "I have been running Asics for many years now. I started with the GT2000 and upgraded to the Kayano22 a few years back. While the difference between the step up from the GT to the Kayano wasn't that noticeable I immediately noticed how much lighter the Kayano 27 seemed to me. LIGHT RUNNING ON AIR! The comfort is still excellent, bar none in my humble opinion, and keeps my foot aligned.I have had my Kayano22(fluorescent green) for five years now and they still feel and look great. I still use it them for runs. Time will tell if these are of the same build quality.": "5", "These are solid shoes I feel supported and energized when I wear them. Best running shoes and I'm been through several Kayano models over the years.  They look heat they breathe and they're light and durable.": "5", "Finally discovered right show for my flat feet. No more feet pain after removing shoes or getting out of bed.": "5", "Great shoes. I'm glad I bought these. Ever since I bought them I've nothing but compliments.": "5", "These shoes are as advertised. They are very comfortable and feel like the help spring your foot forward. However, both of my shoes have a very uncomfortable crease in the toe box that rubs on my big toes. I had the same issue with another pair I bought previous to these shoes.": "4", "I've owned version after version and was consistently happy with each new version. That was until I put on the 27s. My first reaction was simply 'blah'. There was nothing exciting about them. I tried to tell myself they would be better once I had a few miles on them. After a couple weeks I have about 25 miles on them and still not impressed. I've set them aside and gone back to my Kayano 25s for any run over 5 miles. For me the 25s have better cushioning and hug my foot better.": "1", "Able to wear all day without my feet hurting.  Do not need to break in before wearing": "5", "I use these shoes for everyday walking....very comfortable and supportive.. Would like to obtain additional inserts..": "5", "Feels great on my foot!

They are so well cushioned and comfortable.": "5", "Very sturdy and supportive, and very comfortable to wear throughout the day.I bought these to replace my Nike Free Rn shoes that I had been using previously for everything from weigh lifting to grocery shopping and running. These are fantastic at all of the above and never leave my feet feeling sore or tired. Albeit they have a bit more cushion than I had originally intended, they do not disappoint whatsoever. They do not feel bulky, heavy or clunky. 5/5!": "5", "Love the shoe...stable, great feel, put 6 miles on them the first time I laced them up!!": "5", "The Gel-Kayano 27 is the most comfortable, lightweight shoes I've ever worn! I'm glad I got these pairs and hope to now be part of the ASICS family. I'm on my feet all day at work and I needed a pair of shoes that was comfortable but yet not break down too fast like my other shoes. The moment I put these Kayano 27 on, I felt much relief on my feet. Something in the gels and cushions massages your feet as u walk/run and just like car tires, it moves well with your feet on turns. Thanks ASICS for delivering a great pair of shoes!": "5", "Great shoe. I love them. Only complaint is the shoe creased at the toe and you can feel it. My wife's shoe did the same thing.": "4", "Fabric around the toe box bent in and rubbed my toes. Submitted multiple inquiries and never heard back from asics.": "1", "I said it at the start: If you are looking for a stability trainer, the GEL-Kayano 27 should be on your list to try. The shoe is a classic. When it comes to comfort the upper delivers, and the overall quality of the build is above average. I'd recommend the Kayano 27 to the runner that is looking for stability in a durable daily training shoe.": "5", "Best running shoes I've ever owned. So solid and support is amazing.": "5", "These shoes have good stability and therefore have resolved shin splints and back pain that I experienced from having flat feet with pronation.": "5", "Great looking and comfortable shoe.

There is a plastic toe guard that seems to be defective on the right shoe, because it cuts into my big toe when running. The left shoe is very comfortable.": "2", "Best Kayano ever!  More colors please... Favorite shoe ive ever owned.": "5", "These are true to the comfort and durability I have come to love about Kayanos. Great for running or wearing around town (maybe in a more subtle color). As long as I'm not running on trails (have Fujitrabucos for that), these are amazingly comfortable to run in and I will continue to buy Kayano for as long as they continue with this fit and feel.": "5", "Very comfortable. Rigid in good places (outside of the shoe behind the heel and across the arch of the sole) and cushion in good places (under the heel and ball of foot). Size was good. I have enjoyed several Kayano models so far and this one did not disappoint.": "5", "The shoe isn't comfortable near the toe.  The material is hard": "3", "Very comfortable. My 2nd  Gel- Kayano. Good cushion.I work long hours and my feetLoves it. No more calloses.": "5", "Best fitting running shoe I've ever had.

I purchased the lime green ones and I love the look and the feel of them! They are the best looking running shoes I have found in years.": "5", "I have owned 3 previous models of the Kayano.  I am not as much a fan of the 27's based on the fact that when I push off, the the toe box \"creases\" a little bit and ends up hitting my toe.  This is vey annoying when walking especially.  I don't feel it as much when I am running.  I had to return them.": "2", "Left doesn't match right. Ties that hold mesh to the sole pull near big toe when shoe flexes": "3", "Another solid sneaker from ASICS.  I use these one more for walking around than for running, as the Gel Nimbus is my go to running shoe.": "5", "These are my 5th Kayanos. Usually walking shoes but strictly using these for running. So far so good": "5", "I'm loving this shoe. It is really comfortable and has great support. It literally hugs my foot in all the right places. If you've never bought ASICS before then just get the size that you normally get in Nike. If you're thinking about getting these shoes then just do it. You won't regret it. I actually bought 2!": "5", "Great pair of sneakers very comfortable and light on your feet. It has excellent arch and hilll support": "5", "Beautiful shoe, awesome to run in. Great support. I have recommended to all my friends and family.": "5", "Reviewed tons of options before going with this one, including last year's Kayano 26. This shoe is incredibly comfortable and the fit is perfect for me. Couldn't be happier with my choice.": "5", "Great comfortable shoes for running. Feels like a cloud when running on them.": "5", "Nimbus user for the last 15 years but I switched to Kayano to see how they felt.  Great shoe and gives a bit more cushioning than the Nimbus.  My mileage is much lower now but my old body needs more cushioning so they are a great choice for me.": "5", "Amazing and comfortable! I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a good sneaker to run.": "5", "They are awesome. They fit to size and are very comfortable.

I can't really run or wear the shoe at all.": "1", "Lots of little fabric spurs in the heel and wear immediately after only a few times walking in the shoe. If I were to try running, my heel would blister. The structure and fit are great.": "2", "Stopped counting how many versions of this shoe I've used.One of my favorite shoes on the market.They last seems to have narrowed over the years, but the fact that Asics builds these in extra wide widths is what brings me back. They seem to have solved the eyelet blow out issue from 26! That put me into Brooks until the 27 came out. One thing about the 27 is, the tongue is really narrow! Weird! When I tie my shoes I can see my socks sometimes. That's a first. Most Kayano devotes will be happy with shoe.": "3", "My recently purchased these Gel-Kayano 27 have been worthy shoe fit great": "5", "Love these!

Way better then I expected and the soles are great for my back with my job!": "5", "Wear these for work , lot of up and down and walking with weight , so far proving to be a great buy.": "5", "Good shoes but much different than expected. Much more room inside than expected.": "2", "The shoe  are very confortable and light . After a few use they fit like glove. Good tracci\u00f3n on hard surface.": "5", "Good construction, fit, build, and looks. The only gripe I have is that the shoe sort of tilts your foot towards a very slight pronation. Not the best for me since I already pronate": "4", "Shoes grown on me, I didn't fall in love at first. Still comfortable and same quality like other ASICS. Shoe is a little wide than I expected, otherwise I'm content.": "4", "I bought these for my 13 yr old son. He normally wears a 10 1/2 but these were way too big for him. He did say they were very comfortable but we're having to send them back because none of the stores in my area have them. We're going to maybe go down a half size to a 10.": "4", "Color described as Piedmont Grey/Piedmont Grey, a more accurate description would be Piedmont Grey/Coral Pink. I was hoping it would be more of a red or even orange but its pink so I put them back in the box and sent them back.  Also the split tongue makes no sense and looks terrible.": "1", "very comfortable for a walking a lot and fits great with jeans ,": "5", "Amazing shoe. Super comfortable. Real soft suede.ASICS needs to make more 1 color Gel Lytes. And you can't beat the price either.": "5", "Shoe run a little small. I brought a size up.

Comfortable. However, the split tongue is not for me, and the Orange looks way more orange in person. It looks more subtle on the website. I also didn't care for that. I would love this shoe if it had a tongue, and maybe different color options besides Orange. I returned this shoe, and still waiting on my refund. Thank you.": "2", "Great materials, very comfortable. Can't go wrong with a GEL-LYTE III best shoes I ever wore!": "5", "True to size. Classic ASICS comfort. One thing to note is the transparent toe and lateral/medial sides.

Asics have always been apart of my plethora of shoes. Especially the Gels": "4", "The best  sneakers  I have ever purchased.However,  they were too narrow and you did not offer wide.": "4", "Suede is extremely high quality. Toe box shape is great.

Plus they mad comfy.": "5", "This shoe sucks. It's very misleading. Nobody and I mean nobody wants a show where the tongue splits open down the middle. I can't believe you guys don't advertise this horrendous design in the photos. Oh wait I actually can believe it because then you guys know as well as I do that no one would buy these. These are the worst shoes I've ever purchased in my 22 years alive. If zero stars was an option I'd pick that": "1", "Comfortable shoes i love the Gel Lyte iii .

I usually wear a 7m/8.5w in most sneakers....i have purchased the gel lyte III in other styles and my previous purchase size was 8m and the fit was roomy in the toe box. It did not feel oversized at all and was still comfortable.I purchased this particular model in a 7.5m because the 8m sold out and to me this felt like the perfect fit...but i do have to note that this model has a split tongue. So if you are ok with the split tongue having a slight gap and your socks showing go with a half size up, if you want the split tongue to fully close like i do, go a full size up.": "5", "Color on the mesh wasn't exactly as expected but my big issue is not double boxing sneakers. The box came completely crushed and one of the shoes was crushed coming in. Double boxing is a standard.": "2", "the color palette is fantastic and dropped just in time for summer. the silhouette is classic and being a asics, it is one of the most comfortable sneakers i've worn": "5", "Great shoe!!!!  Very comfy and crazy color blocking!!!!": "5", "Shoe looks great when browsing the web. When it arrived, and I saw it in person, I was very disappointed. Mesh is see through.

Returned one and gave the other away to a family member.": "4", "Asics have their own unique style and comfort to them and me personally I love them because the design is nice and unusual. However it all depends on what your into that really answers your question on whether you should buy Asics or not and what kind of Asics you want because they have a variety of colors and designs you just have to find a pair that truly expresses you and what you want.": "5", "I was fairly surprised in the quality of the shoe for the price. Other sites have it listed for 70 or so and it's only 49 here with a lot of sizes so i got the shoe. The shoe shipped quick and no kinda damage to the box or shoe. The tracking was right on and exact.": "4", "They run a lil small since they have the split tongue I feel they should B looser over too I your foot": "3", "True to size .Very stylish and reasonable price.

I have an impressive Nike Foamposite collection, but was looking to switch to another shoe due to all the Hypebeasts buying foamposites now. The Gel Lyte III is a perfect shoe. I can dress it up, or down. Amazing quality, no defects! I've had the shoe for about a month and it still shocks me at how light it is. The color scheme is beautiful, but this shoe always comes in great colors.": "5", "Just a great sneaker, I guess that's why they keep selling them.": "5", "Very comfortable..vibrant colors schemes that look even better in person..must buy": "5", "These sneakers are the best they are so comfortable and I like the fact that it doesn't have a tongue which make it extra cute thinking of getting another pair.": "5", "I work 12 hours shift in the ER and this shoes are very comfortable to be on my feets all day": "5", "Verrrry comfy.... match with other stuff well... wld definitely buy again n recommend to friends": "5", "Bought these for my boyfriend and he LOVED them. I thought they'd be too red but it's actually perfect and look great. He loves the style and comfort. He's a sneaker head so his taste has moved to the gel lyte iii's for the moment.": "5", "Take a look into my shoe selection and all you'd see is nikes and jordans with a few random brands in the mix. However, I decided to move over to the Asics brand because of their commitment to comfort, performance and style. The Gel Lyte 3 is a sleek shoe and with the right color way, it really makes them pop out. I was going banannas about the Burgundy colorway because the hints of royal and navy blue really add to the uniqueness of this shoe. From the very moment I put them on my feet, I knew I was in good hands. Durability depends soley (no pun intended) Of all 4 retro j's that I have (that I were once equally excited to have) these have been my best purchase in a long time.": "5", "the gel lyte iii fit a little tight at the toe box might want to go up half a size other then that is a good shoe to walk in. has 3m on the asics logo and come with 2 laces burgundy and navy. this review is for the burgundy color gel lyte iii": "5", "The colorway of red/blue/white is extremely pleasing to the eyes. The padding adds immense comfort to the feet. Awesome shoe in my opinion.": "4", "After trying these on once I received them I was impressed with the way they fit me, since I have flat feet. I do love the color scheme, blue and grey accents along with the 3m stripes on the upper. The split tongue always is an interesting and unique touch to the shoe. The blue camo on the insole is a nice touch as well. Walking around in them comfortable too, although the shoe is narrow it still fits me well. Personally I think the price should be less than $99. But overall it doesn't take away from the shoe.": "5", "I walk a lot so this shoe is fantastic, it's lite weight very comfortable inner sole with cushion. It's overall a great shoe.": "5", "Excellent model...leather is immaculate, very nice!! Comfort and style as usual... bought the black and white pair!!": "5", "These are made work premium materials and both feel & look great on-foot.

Ridiculously comfortable": "5", "Great comfy shoe! I own multiple pair and various colorways": "5", "I bought the red/black color way.  My only advice is that the red is more of a radiant red. The pics online make this look darker than what it really is. Still a great shoe though! If you've seen the radiant red airmax90s it looks close to that.": "4", "Love the materials on this model...super premium and GL3 comfort as always!! Love this shoe!": "5", "These retros are the best. It's simple but beautiful. Love the color way": "5", "Fits true to size. Material quality is nice for the price point and I love the color blocking for this shoe. Would definitely recommend.": "5", "These Daruma GL IIIs are great, the materials are nice and the colorway is so nice.   It remind me of the Chicago colorway with hints of gold.   They come with extras also; a Daruma hangtag and 2 rivet like things to go into the eyelets with a Japanese character oh them.  Nice touch.": "5", "Gel Lyte IIIs are great. An underrated classic.

Make \"OG\" the new standard!": "5", "I had a pair of these in high school back in 92 and there were my favorite sneaker since then. I was happy to see the 30th Anniversary release because I have been waiting for this colorway for year. They are just as comfortable as they were then.  Main difference that I noticed is the the purple is slightly off but still an awesome shoe.  Thank you": "5", "They are perfect.

In the pics these look to be red/black/white.  arrived as neon orange and not red.  Are they using saturation on their pictures to the extreme?  some what dumb founded how they can not get a decent picture of the actual colors the shoe is.  Love the shoe, so not returning them, but honestly am really bummed about the neon orange.": "4", "Amazing job on the reshaping process and the overall original shape the gl3": "5", "Finally got this classic style. Overall quite pleased.": "5", "Purchased for my friend and he loves them. I guess I need to get me a pair...lol": "5", "Love the Asic Gel Lyte III. Colorways are dope!!!!": "5", "Very good support when running. Stylish and comfortable, the Gel-Lyte III is a great sneaker.": "5", "More comfortable than I remember! Glad they brought these back": "5", "It fits well not to tight anywhere good classic shoe": "5", "Classic silhouette, classic color way. High quality materials used. Extremely satisfied.": "5", "I just got mine and am honestly impressed. The retro materials make give these a bespoke look and feel. They come in a special 30th anniversary box (bonus!) and really stand out. Will be ordering more, the only question is how many... ASICS: MAKE THESE THE 'NEW NORMAL'": "5", "One of the most comfortable sneakers I've ever owned. The fact that it's a classic makes it that much better.": "5", "killed the reshape. been collecting gel lyte 3s for six years and this is the best it's gotten back to. cheers": "5", "The shoes are comfortable but I don't like the split tongue. I would've given 5 stars had there been a normal tongue.": "4", "I do about 30-35 miles per week (road work) and this shoe has been excellent!": "5", "I'm on my feet most of the day and these are perfect": "5", "The Asics Gel lyte is very comfortable and i like the colors.": "5", "Nice looking shoe, fits a little narrower than I have come to expect from ASICS.": "4", "Very nice runner.  Like my gel lyte III's, I wear this as a lifestyle shoe, rather than for running.Firmer feel compared to III's, and runs slightly large - I wear a 9 in III's and needed to order a 8.5 in the XXX's.": "5", "Look really great. Very on trend. It also fits and feelds great. Lot of compliments.": "5", "These shoes are very stable and comfortable.  Ive worn then 7 days straight walking 10K+ steps per day and my feet feel great.  The split tongue design is very odd though.  It leaves an open spot on my foot where the laces tie which seems like a bad idea, but so far no problems.  I would suggest making the split tongue overlap more so there is no open area exposing the socks.": "4", "Great shoes. Good support, lite. Supports heavy runners.": "5", "The shoes look nice, but have a hard plastic feel and very hard to break in, and my foot has been aching and hurting even a few weeks after running in them.": "2", "Very comfortableRelaxingAnd stylishReally doing great job": "5", "They valid. Can't really flex because of quarantine.": "5", "These shoes were a dream for my feet! Had zero issues with the size. Super cushion for the bottom of my feet which is great for shock absorption if you stand or walk all day. I highly recommend this shoe!": "5", "Very comfortable shoe.. Like walking on air.  Nice looking.": "5", "So comfortable, fits as espected, the cushioning is the difference with the 22.": "5", "Very narrow and the pressure points on the bottom of the shoes are more for runners. I just walk a lot, so it didn't work.": "3", "Way too tight!!!  What about some 2E width for people with normal feet": "1", "I have been wearing Gel Nimbus for a number of years. My first pair were the 8's. Each year they seem to get better.  I'm to the point where no other shoe feels good on my feet.": "5", "I wear these everyday for work.  I have had a 4 compartment faciotomy preformed on both legs and these are the only brand shoes that don't cause excess pain.  Thanks for being consistently comfortable y'all.": "5", "I have been using the Gel-Nimbus series since Nimbus 15 and every successive model has always been worth the money. Given the size of my feet, I don't feel very comfortable with many of the brands out there. The nimbus 23 is very comfortable and fits me just perfectly fine.": "5", "I have owned ASICS Nimbus for around almost 15 years and have bought at least 30 pairs and these are the best yet.": "5", "Love the fit, support and look! Really comfortable": "5", "Horrible fit and feel.  The neutrality of the shoe has disappeared": "1", "These are the most comfortable Nimbus I have run in": "5", "Recently your line of Kayano and now Nimbus models are cut wider in forefront of shoe. Or it's your new design(s).I've worn size 8 in your Kayanos for 10 years.But the last pair #26, cut wide & fits loose.So I tried these Nimbus... same issue.Disappointed on the change.": "1", "Very comfortable and supportive.  Amble room for my toes and hug my heel very well.  Great shoe.": "5", "Great shoe. Fits great and good responsive feel on pavement, cinder, and of course the treadmill.": "5", "I see a huge difference with the new Nimbus 23. They feel much lighter on my feet and have better support. I feel like I want to keep going and going while running in these. Great shoe all around!!": "5", "Perfect exercises shoes. Soft, perfect for exercises.": "5", "I like the fit of these shoes.  The cushioning is extra soft.  It maintains good support and looks good. I normally get Hoka Bondi but these are a good shoe to rotate with them.": "5", "Awesome shoes.  I always buy Asics.  Very comfortable and fit well.": "5", "They didn't fit. I had to send them back.  I've been buying the same size ASICS for years. This one was at least half a size too small.": "1", "very similar to the 22. still excellent shoe. Love it.": "5", "These shoes are Asics best shoe since the Nimbus 21. I like them much better then the Nimbus 22's. They are extremely comfortable. The design is great. The texture is much better then the 22's. I recommend with five stars.": "5", "Shoes are comfortable, but rt top of shoe keeps going through the material on top. Have tried three pair unsuccessively.": "2", "Great shoe for anyone suffering from plantar fasciitis.": "5", "Unbelievably comfortable.  I always stick with the Gel Nimbus (why try to fix what isn't broken?!). It is the maximum cushioning I am after, and these running shoes are 5-stars. I really like the arch support as well. I ordered the Digital Grape/Black which is a lively and fun color combination.": "5", "Great shoe. A worthy successor in the gel nimbus line.": "5", "Super comfy and very supportive. Fit true to size. Great shoe": "5", "I work at an animal shelter and walj a ton. These shoes are so comfortable and make it easy to be on my feet all day.": "5", "The shoes are slippery on my treadmill and make a lot of noise when I walk on my wood floor": "2", "very comfortable shoe for long runs. no knee pain. I am a heavy guy 6 Foot 1 weighting 245. this is my fourth pair of nimbus and I recommend.": "5", "These are absolutely incredible! I have very high arches, and undersupinate when running. These are fantastic for support and comfort. Matter of fact i bought these shortly after i bought last years gray patterned Gel Nimbus 23's, and it's insane to even think they are the same style of shoe. Last years model is stiff, and when I run in them I feel the strike throughout my knees and ankles when running. Hopefully they get more of these in stock, cause i will order several pair more.": "5", "Very very comfortable shoes! These shoes keep your feet energized. True to fit.": "5", "At 69 years age, I have sensitive feet and very high arches.  In combination with Foot Scientific Orthotics, I am able to walk 2-3 miles pain free.  The shoes have really helped": "5", "My husband loves these. They fit well and look sharp.": "5", "Sneakers are good but the new cup inside the heel of the shoe cuts into my heel sometimes when I'm running": "4", "Excellent support and comfort.  Noticeable improvement from previous years for this model.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe even after 12 hours on my feet.": "5", "Excellent fit and comfortable -- love the color combinations.": "5", "very comfortable shoe. you can't even tell you have them on  grip is great I bought mine when they only had a couple colors I wish I had gotten a flashier color": "5", "These shoes are very comfortable, with great cusion which absorbs the majority of the impact when running. They are light, but still maintain the integrity of the much needed support in a running shoe. Thumbs up!": "5", "Very comfortable and roomy. I have planters in my heel and was looking for relief. looks like I found it.": "5", "Accidental ran over one of the shoes in the garage with car. Still works great! I feel like I have an extra bounce to my step during my shifts at the hospital.": "5", "Was recommended by a friend. Awesome tennis very comfortable with alot of support on feet.": "5", "I've been a long time Asics Nimbus user going back to the Asics Nimbus 12.  Asics had made changes and I had noticed sizing issues with the last four versions (19-22).  They were narrower and I had to go up a half size.  The last version -22 it seemed I had some quick wearing out issues.  Asics addressed my issues and I am pleased to now report on the 23's.  The sizing is back! I am in my original size (10.5) and the area in the toe box has improved and not as narrow as the past four versions.  The overall cushion of the shoes seems to be improved as well.  I am optimistic that they have listened to their loyal customers and gone back to what is tried and true.  I like the 23's and have since bought a second pair to rotate my shoes.  I've only put on about 30 miles at this point so an early review.  Happy running!": "4", "Excelente Producto muy c\u00f3modas las recomiendo muy suaves": "5", "I really like asics shoes. I gave these as a gift to one of our sons and he really likes them.": "5", "excellent foot, and heel support. no pain now! helped my plantar": "5", "COMFORT & SUPPORT!!! Great for CROSS TRAINING, RUNNING & HIKING": "5", "Very comfortable and provides great support.  My husband has several pairs of the Gel Nimbus 22 and finds the 23 to be even more comfortable.": "5", "Great shoe extremely comfortable highly recommend!": "5", "They looked a little too narrow as I have wide feet however don't judge a book by it's cover because I put these things on and they are probably the cushiest shoes I've ever worn, I've only worn them around the house so far cuz I just got them today but they are super cushiony and they look like they're very well made I like them they earn five stars": "5", "Have bought a new pair of Gel Nimbus every year.  Usually love the shoe. But I won't wear depressing black and grey when I am trying to work out.  Count me out this year unless they release new colors.": "1", "I think it is a fantastic shoe but as the other reviewer I do agree it is slightly tight at first. I I I I did notice some people complain about the tightness - I agree with it but the mesh does stretches after a few wears. For me, it was the color that bothered me the most. In the picture, it has beautiful shades, tones, and coloration, but in reality, it is dull, and a bit cheap looking grey, honestly not as pictured at all. I bought the grey once with blue overtones and yellow soles. Now I regret it.": "3", "This nimbus 23 is a amazing shoe and super worth it": "5", "Very excited to try Nimbus 23, the style and comfort are exactly what you'd expect from Asics.  Unfortunately, these shoes are quite narrow and very tight around the forefoot - I lost feeling in my feet after only a few minutes. Also not a lot of room around the toes.": "3", "Every time I am tempted away to an alternate shoe I regret it. The Nimbus is the best all round shoe I have every used and I will stay faithful whilst they keep improving whilst staying true to the proven formula.": "5", "Don't get caught up in these being named after a cloud. They're not soft. They're quite firm. Too firm. I've tried a couple of versions now and they're just stiff.": "2", "Quality of shoe seems to be deteoritating with each upgraded model, since 2000 7.  Also, shoe laces too long.": "2", "Excellent Asics GT-2000 9's!!Love the stability!!": "5", "Fit like a glove. Absolutely the lightest and most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned.": "5", "These shoes are considerable more firmer than I had anticipated. From all the reviews I read, I was excepted them to have a lot more give or softness in the sole. My Crocs are even more softer then these shoes.": "3", "Defective Shoe. Submitted for warranty claim and still no word from Asics.": "1", "Usually excellent purchase - but too narrow wish they offered in 4E size": "1", "Hard to argue with a shoe that performs like it's predecessor in my closet, GT2000 4.  But it's clearly not as snug and sleek looking and my foot seems to be \"lost\" in it. I use them in the gym, so I cannot comment on running. Colors recently severely lacking- women's colors much cooler looking.  Solid shoe, but not great IMO.": "4", "Fits great, always have a problem with the heel popping out of the back of the shoe. Doesn't happen with this one.": "5", "Lightweight, sturdy, comfortable.  Just what I would expect from ASICS. I've been running in various ASICS models since 2005, and these live up to my expectations.  Highly recommend.": "5", "Comfortable for sure, my last ASICS lasted 7 years, hope these do too": "5", "I tried these shoes on in the store size 11, was told they were too small and recommended to order size 11.5. Shoes came and are certainly too big.": "1", "My 13 y/o son had been wearing a different brand, religiously for years now. He is a big kid and is a heel striker when he runs so he needs cushion, support and despite his affinity with the other brand, he got these GT2000-9s and said \"what other shoes?\" The gel in the heel make these the most comfortable shoes he has ever known and he is now all in for Team Asics! The shoes are nice looking, they are noticeably more comfortable than other shoes we have tried and Asics now has a devoted customer in my son.  Now we need to find him some Asics weather proof hiking boots!": "5", "Excellent fit, great support, heel provides a snug fit. I usually wear Kayanosm, but I am definitely not disappointed in this shoe. Asics rules !!!": "5", "When training I tend overpronate and these shoes help to correct that. Great pair, solid in all circumstances. Would definitely recommend to anyone.": "5", "Comfortable and fits well. More of a causal shoe then a running shoe.": "5", "Best Asics shoe for arch support and comfort. Great value. The GT-2000-9 turned out great.": "5", "I love the gt2000s as a high school cross country athlete, I just wish there was a way to get them cheaper or at a reduced price because i'm constantly buying new ones and my dad recently passed away so times are not really good right now.": "5", "Light as a feather. True fit (7.5 Med). Lightly cushioned. Attractive (Gray/Lime).One complaint: heel loop is gone; but that seems to be the way of the world now. I'd buy'em again.": "5", "The feel great to walk in, but I have yet to run in them. I really like the bright and dark color mixture.": "5", "These shoes are so comfortable. The color is phenomenal!": "5", "The GT 2000 has been a consistently great shoe. It's all I've worn for several years.": "5", "I've been running in Asic running shoes for over thirty years. The last few pairs of your GT model the fabric on the toe box wears out after about a hundred miles. Both shoes end up with holes in the fabric. This pair I just got I put duct tape on the inside of the toe box to see if that helps. I hope your future models have better fabric or something to stop the fabric from tearing as I really don't want to switch to another brand": "1", "comfortable shoes, very light on your feet, highly recommend these shoes": "5", "Comfortable and lightweight, first time trying asics and I'll never get another running shoe": "5", "Full disclosure: despite being a loyalist of this series,  I did not enjoy the 2000 7. I found the ride in that shoe to be not just firm, but harsh and fairly unremarkable. As a result, I skipped the 2000 8. Fast forward to this year, I took a chance on 2000 9s and I am really glad that I did. This is an absolutely excellent update to one of Asics' core models. The shoe is noticeably more comfortable as soon as you step in and fits true to size. Moreover, the ride is great. Some stability shoes are so overbearing that they feel like they're trying to alter your gait, which is never good. This is not one of those shoes. The 2000 9 provides just the right amount of light support to get you through your run when fatigue sets in and your form might deteriorate. It is also especially good on those days when you have tired legs. The run experience in this shoe is very fluid and definitely not \"in your way\". So far,  I have run everything from a fast 5k, to a 10k, to an easy-paced 10 miler in them and the 2000 9s have done very well in each case. This is a comfortable, durable, Jack-of-all-trades running shoe in the best sense and an excellent update to the line. Well done, Asics!": "5", "By far the best shoes I have owned. Very comfortable and true to size. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a light comfortable shoe.": "5", "I have been wearing the GT-2000 series since the late 1990s, and they continue to be the best out-of-the-box comfortable and durable shoes for stability I have ever used.": "5", "Confortable for more flat footed runners....love them": "5", "This are my third pair of GT 2000, as always great running shoes.": "5", "GT 2000's JUST KEEPING GETTING BETTER EACH YEAR  , GT 2000 9  ARE THE BEST SHOW i HAVE EVER RUN IN AND I HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR 41 YEARS , 55 - 60 MILES A WEEK .I will keep using ( get a new pair every 300 miles ) until GT 2000 10'S come out , don't know how you going to top the 9's but Asics will .": "5", "These have been great for my short runs during the week.": "5", "Very comfortable, stable shoe for hard surfaces. Value worth the cost.": "5", "Great model of running shoe from Asics. This is my second pair of GT-2000's and these feel lighter and more streamlined than the previous model. Good comfort and support with no additional bulk.": "5", "Very stylish and comfortable shoe for anyone with external pronation.": "5", "Just got these and first impressions are:- Nice looking offering for a 4E width, love the orange pop on the rubber- Great fit and cushioning- The laces aren't long enough to do a heel lock racers loop, so why even have the extra hole then?- Tongue is so big. It is brushing against the opposing foot during running. I can literally feel it catching the wind and slowing me down.  ASICS, please stop making drag-chutes for tongues - they can be padding just make them a little more sleek, and not like a 1980s reebok pumps high-top tongue.": "4", "GT-2000 9's carry on the tradition of GT excellence. If you've enjoyed the comfort and support of predecessors you'll love the 2000 9. After putting 450 miles on my version 8's the cushion of a new pair was noticeable and welcomed.  Bravo ASICS, you've got another winner.": "5", "I purchased this shoe for both running and walking.  It fits great and is very comfortable. I have worn Asics in the past and have never had any problems with their product.  The width is perfect on this shoe and the cushioning provides great support where needed.": "5", "Love these shoes.  This is the first pair of ASICS shoes I have purchased and have already purchased a second pair (GT-2000 8) - very comfortable.  Also, great color options.": "5", "Love the shoes- this OSS my second pair and they've always worked great for me.  This iteration is lighter and better built than my last pair I think": "5", "The tongue of the shoe is narrow so if it's not perfectly centered your socks will shoe through the laces.  Comfortable shoe for both a toe or heel strike.": "4", "I went on a vacation so I needed to purchase some walking shoes for sight seeing. Most shoes I've purchased after awhile of walking i feel small back pain in lower back not with these, the support and comfort made a big difference no back pain at all. Great job asics on these shoes!": "4", "The process of getting my shoes on line was easy and convenient. The shoes fit well and feel great!": "5", "Got them for my husband and he loves them for running": "5", "I am a fireman so I'm on my feet all day and need a tough comfortable shoe. The GT-2000 9 meets both of these criteria! Great shoe!": "5", "The shoe fits well and very comfortable. The colorist is on point.": "5", "Awesome design and top tier comfort. Would expect nothing less": "5", "This is an amazing shoe! Great looking and comfortable!": "5", "Not for narrow feet. They bug the side of my foot by my small toe. Probably ok if you have thin feet. They look really cool thou": "2", "They are nice looking shoes. The only issue I found was that they are a bit tight on the sides. Once you worn them out a bit they get comfortable. I recommend.": "4", "Shoes are tight over the toes and do not offer much room for movement of food": "1", "I have only gone about 30 miles so far, but the shoe is OK. I love that it is lighter, and there is more cushioning in the sole. However, the padding around the heel is less than some ASICS models that I have had in the past.": "4", "This was my first ASICS and it is defected and you guys won't even refund me nor cover the shipping fee. I would honestly never pick this brand again.": "1", "great shoe at a good price.  cushioning and response are great for old, heavy footed runners.  uppers need work though and they run large.  order 1/2 size down from what you normally wear. loose upper means stability problems.  i will order again when the upper is improved.": "4", "I love the shoe but include longer laces. Everyday I'm just annoyed.": "4", "These shoes are awesome! I got wide feet and breaking in new shoes usually do a number on my feet the first four or five times walking in them. Was worried at first glance shoes looked narrow but to my surprise they fit perfectly and first jog in them was pain free! Love these shoes and just bought another pair. Really rare I find shoes that work for me the first time I put them on.": "5", "For me this is a great easy run / recovery shoe. I'm currently in a marathon training cycle so these fit right in my rotation. However, the midsole on these do NOT flex easy, so if your feet prefer a flexible shoe you'll want to stay away and try like a Brooks Glycerin or a Saucony Triumph": "3", "These were a gift to my husband and he loves them. They are extremely comfortable and offer a lot of cushiony support. He uses these as his long distance running shoe. I am considering getting a pair for myself": "5", "Great shoe. It will rejuvenate your desire to go running. Your feet keep moving in these things and give a bounce in your legs. I have put in just over 30 miles in them and I am very happy with the purchase and continue to look forward to running in them daily. The shoes look great as well and the upper is great on these. Seem to will last for a long time. After deciding I wanted to buy these shoes I did a search and found that Finish Line had them $40 off for a unique color that I have only seen from their website. What a deal!!! I will check Finish Line first for my future running shoe purchases.I do recommend sizing down half a size as I had seen recommended. Usually I wear a 10.5 and I went with a 10 and they are perfect. My one complaint is that the laces that come with the shoe are very thin with not much flex. They really dug into the top of my feet so I switched the laces out with my old running shoe laces and they are perfect now.": "5", "Love these shoes. Cushioning is great. if there was a way to have the cushioning and a little more stability they'd be five stars. They're great except I can't wear them after a leg day workout lol.": "4", "Great shoe and great support for those long runs ! Very comfortable and comparable to high end racing shoes.": "5", "I have number of daily trainers (New Balance, Nike, Hoka) but the Novablast has moved to the top of the list. I'm an older runner, so I want sufficient cushion to make my long runs easier. This fits the bills and is relatively light. The outsole appears to be long-lasting, and the upper shows little to no wear. What a great shoe!": "5", "Comfortable shoe but warranty not honored..I love the sneaker but never had sneakers tear after just less than 4 months from just walking at the park.": "1", "Great shoe, tongue is a bit thin but the shoe is great.": "5", "The FlyteFoam Blast cushioning is great: plenty of cushion, but very responsive--not mushy at all. Great price from Finish Line on these!": "5", "I got the novablast NP very light feeling very good and with a thick sock at number 45 Europe": "5", "Very comfortable ride. Good rebound. Would recommend": "5", "These are best shoes and make you feel like you are walking on air. I use them for running and walking and love them. Can't believe I waited so long to buy them.": "5", "Excellent running shoe, very comfortable and ready out of the box.": "5", "Great comfort and support.  Cushions great for my job at the hospital.": "5", "I'm an old guy (65) with football and baseball knees and have been wearing Tigers since the 60s. The NOVABLAST is just an incredible shoe for active adults who still power walk and exercise daily. I keep three pair around at all times (home, office, car) and just love them!": "5", "Great everyday trainers for the road.  Nice and bouncy and comfortable.  Might order another pair!  Easy transaction with Finish Line!": "5", "Excellent cushioning. Use on my long run and legs are in good shape afterwards": "5", "This is actually my third pair of this shoe. Some people might find it a pinch unstable but I love the ride. The foam is just right": "5", "My go to running shoes are Nimbus and Cumulus and I decided to get these to get a lighter shoe. First I could tell these are set for underpronators. I wear heavily on the outside of the heel, and I could tell during my run that I was rolling from to back of the shoe closer to the inside of the foot. If you are an overpronator, it is not for you. There is some heel slip, and I will have to correct it with changing my laces to heel lock set up. I did feel that bounce during the run and they felt light. The rubber sole is thin, so I am going to use these for long runs and not as my regular running shoes. It was interesting on my walk home after my run, I felt like the shoes were doing all of the walking. The rocking shape felt like my feet wanted to go forward and with less effort.": "5", "I like it!   Please continue to come out with more colors!   I'm stil looking for one which is grey with white stripes!": "5", "These shoes are fantastic. they literally feel like you have trampolines under your feet. I'm a nurse and work 12 hr shifts and my feet did not feel tired at the end of the day.My only complaint is I flew the shoe could have more padding in the upper and the tongue could be a tad shorter but again the middle is fantastic.": "4", "Love Novablast, this is my 2d pair! Good fit and great bounce!": "4", "Worst quality laces I've ever used and I get disgusting blisters on the back of my foot. Other than that, I think they have the potential to become great shoes.": "2", "This shoe feels great on runs. I have read many other reviews on this shoe before my purchase. Some said that it was loud. I have not heard anything even remotely to be what I consider loud.": "5", "Great shoes for running!": "5", "These are the best shoes ever. I love them for work and working out. I'm a nurse and I bought a pair for work and they are the comfiest pair I've own to be on my feet for 13 hours. I also purchased another pair for my gym and when I'm with my trainer it's as if I'm walking on clouds! So light and comfy.": "5", "The cushion in the heel and lightweight material, makes this one of my favorite ASICS": "5", "Got them as a gift for my fianc\u00e9 and he absolutely loved them!": "5", "Has the \"bounce\" and padding I was seeking.  Love them.": "5", "The Novablast is a  fantastic shoe that is very versatile. As an older runner with bad joints and some injury history, I place a premium on cushioning, but I also want the attributes I wanted when I was younger - light weight, responsiveness, good snug fit, etc.  This shoe does it all for me.  I ran in Kayanos for years, and loved them, but they're a little heavy and bulky for racing, plus as I've aged I find I want more cushioning. The Novablasts fit the bill!  The cushioning and comfort is 5/5.  Weight is better than the Kayanos, and they feel like light, responsive, springy racing shoes in comparison.  For me, they are true all-rounders, excelling at tempo runs, longer runs, easy runs, even speedwork and racing.  If anyone is familiar with the Hoka Rincon, these shoes are very similar, with a slightly better fit for me.  The one small thing I would change is in the fit - I could use a slightly wider toebox.  But honestly, that's really nitpicking, and I like a wider toebox than most people.  Overall, a 4.5 for me, leaving a little room to improve the score if the toebox fit me better.  Now expand the Novablast line; lose a little weight and add a carbon plate and you've got the perfect racer!": "5", "Nice & comfortable: After decades of nothing but Kayanos, it felt right to reduce weight and go to more cushioning.  I've not been disappointed.  I've always been a forefoot striker and these seem to work with that.  I'll add some miles and maybe revisit this.": "5", "I liked these shoes for about the first week of running in them.  After that, I noticed a tendency for the shoe to roll inwards and it just continued to get worse over the next week.  It felt like the heel support broke down quickly over those two weeks.  Might be a great shoe for other runners, but not for me.": "1", "I have a mild chondromalacia. These novablast have the perfect cushioning to reduce the knee pain!I am 5 feet 9 inches tall and have no issues with the novablast's stability.": "5", "Great shoes for my very wide feet. They were not bad from the beginning, but after the 30 mile park... just amazing!": "5", "No ankle support what so ever. I put them on outta the box n almost twisted my ankle walking in my house.": "2", "Light and comfortable": "4", "First pair I tried felt great out of the box.  Good energy return off of the toes and could feel my stride improving.  After 100 miles could feel the energy cells starting to fade.Purchased a second pair and was disappointed because I did not feel the same lift off of the toes as the first pair.": "4", "This midsole is amazing. I think y'all have a real contender here with the rest of the top running shoe brands with this new midsole foam. Maybe see about incorporating a carbon plating to get it to be like a top marathon running shoe? I can't wait to put these on and just run in them - something that a running shoe should all be about. This midsole has turned me into buying strictly ASICS again like back in high school.The only complaint is the upper - although breathable and I'm not experiencing any slippage issues that some other reviewers are saying they are having, I have experienced that sometimes the tongue and the lacing causes the tongue or part of the upper to get synched mid-run which can cause some discomfort. I've had to stop my run and adjust to alleviate it a couple times. I think if the upper gets better and maybe a carbon plating option for races, this thing could catapult y'all to the very top beating out the other running shoe brands.Keep making shoes like this ASICS and y'all are going to just dominate the running game!": "4", "These are a great shoe that feels light and fast. In spite of how light they are they have tremendous cushion. Much like the metaride shoes they encourage running fast and decrease fatigue on the legs. This will have a permanent place in my shoe rotation": "5", "Novablast is the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn, hands down.  Asics nailed it with this shoe!": "5", "I used to be very stiff after a run, but not anymore.  Awesome shoe.": "5", "Nice feel and responsive. Not as squishy as the Hoka's I had a couple years ago, which was my fear. Hope to use them a long time. Please don't let your \"wear testers\" suggest \"improvements\". You've got a good shoe here.": "5", "Love Asics, but these were too unstable, within 2 runs I was getting brutal ankle/knee pain.  I don't normally run in stability shoes so didn't think it would be an issue.  They also run about a half size large.  I tried thick socks and a tight heel lock but the laces are uncomfortable.": "1", "Best running shoes i've ever owned. I will continue to purchase.": "5", "Make sure you buckle up and have a helmet on!  These are fast!": "5", "After 2 1/2 weeks of wearing the shoes on both sides the back inside next to the heel has torn. The material is very thin.": "1", "Super comfortable, stylish, and resistant. I am using these shoes as a daily trainer for 30 miles a week. It's holding up excellently.": "5", "When I bought this shoe I though about the advertising and how the shoe bouncy and like trampoline but till now and after 50 miles running on them . There is no energy return at all .soft and muchy  but not bouncy": "3", "very good cushion but stability is weak   sometimes I fell like ankle can be sprained becuase of thick sole": "4", "I use this shoe for walking. The shoe has great cushioning and great heel to toe response. I definitely rate it a five. Yet, I would advise those purchasing any Asics shoe, to use the shoe finder, which is provided on the website. I over pronate the NovaBlast is built for more of a neutral ride. My best advise is, know your running or walking style and purchase the Asics shoes, that are right for you. IMO they are the best on the market.": "5", "I walk only.  Thought the extra cushioning would be good, but the extra cushioning causes less stability and my ankles flex too much.  But I imagine they would be good for running where impact is more important.": "3", "I loved the look of the shoe and I need shoes with padding. No barefoot running for me. I also use a sit to stand desk so I am standing a lot. Need padding for that. These shoes are comfortable from the first wearing. No break in needed. But, they seem to want to push me to the inside of my foot. Not sure if this make sense, but it feels like the insert or the sole leans me in. Not uncomfortable and you only notice it for a few minutes, but if I go from a pair of Nikes to these it is like \"whoa... weird\". I typically don't use custom insoles but am considering it for these shoes. But they are a fun green color to jazz things up, and feel good on my feet. I recommend them. I wear a size 14 and these were a perfect fit.": "4", "My second pair of the novablast. Just love the ride and would highly recommend if u could handle the shoe being slighty unstable.": "5", "Good shoe overall. Personally, I prefer the Asics tongue and heel to be thicker (similar to the Cumulus). I experienced slight heel slip so had to heel lock the laces, which I would prefer not to. The shoe has some instability problems if not running on completely flat surfaces. Biggest pros are the \"bounciness\" of the run and just how light this shoe.": "4", "Comfortable and fast, but at just just shy of 100 miles the shoes already have significant ripping on the cuff from occasional contact with one another. Very dissatisfied with the durability.": "2", "It's feel nice very light weight of shoes and comfortable": "5", "Honestly, the best shoes I have ever placed upon my feet. The wide, supportive heel, the well designed toe, all this makes for a very well executed running shoe, kudos!": "5", "I just love this shoe. No pain, no soress. I have been able to obtain better PR's an using half the energy. I feel like it has a positive bounce that gives me back the energy that I have put in and even doe they look big,  they are pretty light.": "5", "Too small. I always get the same shoe size and this one is so small my toes hurt and I can't wear them. Wasted $$": "3", "Awesome shoe just wush the tread was thicker! Already wearing it out!": "4", "Love the weight and response. Already ordered second pair": "5", "I wear a size 11 in every shoe except this one.  Order a half size smaller or try on at store before ordering online.  I hear a lot of great things about this running shoe but wanted to highlight the shoe size discrepancy which is the reason for the two stars.  Hopefully Asics exchanges for a smaller size so I can actually run in them and give a better review.": "2", "Awesome shoe ,this was my first pair of performance type ASICS and I was not disappointed ,after a long work day i arrived home to my shoes so I decided to go for a light jog in them. When my foot touch the ground I instantly felt the comfort and a burst of energy ,turning my light jog into a 6 mile one. This is an awesome shoe and I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a tempo shoe with excellent comfort ,the materials make your feet almost spring off the concrete when running. Eventually I would like to get another pair so I can rotate between day's.": "5", "I don't feel the trampoline effect that other reviews mentioned. However with the thicker sole and new design it's a much more comfortable shoe to run longer distances. This would be a good half marathon/ full marathon shoes.": "4", "My favorite shoes.  Run 6 days/ 70 miles a week.  Have 2 pair of Novablast in my shoe rotation.": "5", "Nice foam, and pretty bouncy, but for for me it is way too unstable, if you somehow tends to overpronate even a bit, I think this shoes is not for you.": "3", "In love with this shoes, help me run farther and faster.": "5", "Bouncy next generation midsole foam and good geometry. True to size for my men's US 11. Laces are thin and kind of bite into the top of my foot but the ride of the shoe is so fun that it's worth the extra trouble fiddling with the laces to get the right level of lock down. I might swap the laces out at some point.": "5", "I'm a big fan of ASICS for years. Novablast is a game changer as far as cushioning and response to my stride. So far I've ran just under 100miles in them since I purchased it. However when making turns or slight curving  I have to pay attention To not roll my ankle. Something with the design, I've read similar review and it's true.": "4", "They are my favorite shoe. I've run 70 miles in them and they're my go to for anything over 10 miles. I love the bounce I get from the shoe that lifts me through my run.": "5", "Very comfortable, excellent cushioning, stable. Have been running in these ~15miles per week for over one month now and they still feel great": "5", "Comfy, bouncy, breathable, etc. Everything you've heard is true. Only con is the stock laces. Skinny and feel like they cut into you, especially when trying to get a runner's knot cinched tight. Swaped them after 50k and have not looked back.": "4", "Poor quality at the bottom of the tennies.  a sole that provides little durability and is super unstable.": "3", "I usually do not like the asics shoes. the rigid plastic in the middle causes me problems with my knees. I took this shoes because I saw the review by someone I trust. I have to say he was right!. I'm recovering from an injury in my right knee. and with most shoes I can run a mile at best. with this shows I can run with ease I stop only because I'm tired. the cushioning and the bouncing on this shoe is second to none. An amazing shoe!I can only hope that you'll put this foam in all of your shoes. great job!!": "5", "Guess I am accustomed to soft max cushioned shoes, but I found the Novablast too firm and unstable for my liking.": "2", "Bought them a month ago and I am more than pleased! Super responsive and very springy! Lightweight and they just feel fast! This is my second pair of Asics and will be switching from the other brand I used!": "5", "The Novablast offers wonderful impact protection that is palpable even after an hour spent at various paces. And because of the supreme lockdown the upper offers I can use the shoes for strides after a long run. Three stars only because of the lamentable absence of support/stability.  Asics, version 2 please.": "3", "In just a couple of runs with these shoes, I lowered my 5k by 2 1/2 minutes. Nothing else changed. I rotate my shoes and when I run in my others, I can feel the difference in cushioning and fit. I will definitely be buying again.": "5", "Comfortable but fit me a 1/2 size small. Definitely need to upgrade the laces. VERY thin and not like an athletic lace. Uncomfortable on the top of the foot.": "3", "I don't know that \"it's the shoes\", but after a couple weeks of running in NovaBlast, my per mile time and a definitely lower.": "4", "Springy cushioning! Comfortable. Support in the upper is minimal but fine with me. I've only worn them a few times but I like them so far.": "5", "My husband says these shoes have renewed his love of running and he swears that it's like he's running on clouds. Thanks ASICS!": "5", "These shoes are not only super stylish they are very comfortable. Highly recommend.": "5", "For me, shoes run a bit (1/2 size) small. I normally am a 10 but needed a 10.5 in these. Comfortable to run in. Shoelaces are a big negative. They aren't much wider than a dress shoe shoelace and are not comfortable. Need to improve on this.": "3", "Switched from Brooks.   My first pair of ASICS.  Have only run for a couple of years.  Currently running 5 days a week 5k and 10k just for the enjoyment.I love everything about these shoes.Will definitely buy again.": "5", "The comfort of the shoe is amazing! The forefoot cushioning is what I was looking for! The cushion and softness of the shoe have a great response too it! It is true to size. Now for the- what are they thinking apart!!!??? The tongue of the shoe is not a gusseted tongue- it is not sewn to the upper material. The tongue is cheaply made. The top area and side of the tongue is cut odd with material not finished and sharp edges that irritated my foot. I'm trying to figure something to rework the shoe! This is so odd!!!": "3", "Amazing shoes very comfortable.   I have a history  finding  the right pair of shoes do to my foot fracture many years ago.  I tried New Balance, Nike, Adidas,  and Skechers and none of  them compare to The Novablast.  I bought two pair within the last 3 weeks and is looking to get another pair. Awsome shoes and once again very comfortable. Only set back is they can run alittle big in the toe area.  I bought a 12.5 which was and had to purchase a half size smaller.  I did keep both pair because i I experience some swelling.": "5", "Very cushy, long lasting. Clips my pinky toe a little bit. My son loves his. He's 14 with size 15 shoe.": "4", "Amazing shoes to wear for walking and running!!!!!!": "5", "I wanted to love these. I loved the feel of the Flytefoam BUT with my slight pronation (rolling inward) it feels like I was falling out of the inside of the shoe. Even walking was a horrible feeling of falling off and out of the inside wall of my shoe. So unless you have absolutely no pronation, these are not for you. If they revamp these with some support inner and outer, I would absolutely buy these again.": "1", "Novablast invites you to run from the beginning. Super bumby you don't have to make and effort to run hard. True, you feel a little unbalanced first when you try them on due to the big cushion but it is because these shoes want you to go outside and run. The adapt so easily to the ground. A minor thing is that in the inner ankle forms a triangle-shaped gap when you step down,  so maybe the encapsulation needs to be a bit thicker for better support. Maybe you wanna go a half size down because of it cause there is a lot of room in the front.": "5", "These shoes fit way too big. Should say on website to go a minimum of a half size down/ I could even do a full size down that's how big these shoes are. Website does't even offer an exchange, so sadly i just returned them and ended up buying another brand.": "3", "Excellent pair of shoes. Feels a bit unstable at first but that rocker motion tech < 3And go true to size, no 1/2 sizes up/down needed (maybe down if you have narrow feet).  I have very wide feet and went up 1/2 and regret it.  My foot slides around in the shoe.  Ah well... I'll just run in them. Next time though, true to size for me": "5", "I went from 20+ years of running in ASICS GT-2000s to Novablasts as my daily trainer and I'm not sure I'll ever go back!  After 100 miles in these shoes, I love their super-responsiveness and cushioning. Also, my strides are feeling so much more efficient. There's just one design issue that I hope ASICS fixes in the next iteration: the Novablast tongues are unusually long and the patch on the back of them chafes skin when wearing no-show socks.  Ever since this happened to me during a long distance run, I've been wearing higher socks and have not had any other issues.  Highly recommend!": "5", "The best pair of running shoes I have owned. Hands down nothing compares": "5", "Great shoe, the most bounce I have ever felt in a shoe very easy on your legs.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe, great cushioning on the outsole. It does run a little large, which was perfect for me. Only knock on the Novablast would probably be the stability; it could be more secure when running corners.": "4", "Ran my fastest mile and fastest 1/2 marathon in my first two runs in the shoes.": "5", "This is a great daily trainer. Great cushion and responsive ride. The shoe can be a little unstable due to the high stack height, however, overall a great shoe! One more minor problem is the laces can dig into your foot of the tongue is not positioned properly.": "5", "I love the shoes. My feet are wides and they are a fit great. The shoe has the right amount of cushion. Not to hard but not like running on a pillows.": "5", "Comfortable and sturdy. Huge improvement over my previous pair. Feel like wearing them 24 hrs a day.": "5", "I run 200miles / month 13.1miles run today This shoes fit and comfortable cushion for me Thank you \"Seth James Demoor\" YouTube channel and off course ASICS novablast project team!": "5", "I returned them because they are to narrow. They do not make any wide sizes.": "4", "Just received these yesterday but I will be returning them. I wear W10 and these are too big. There is too much room in the toe box and they slip off my heels. However, they were so comfortable. I can't wait to get a good fitting pair and go for a run, I'm so excited. I wore them around the house and the comfort level was amazing. I'm so disappointed that I will have to wait at least a week to run in them. I didn't pay attention and use the fit guide when I purchased them. I wear a 10 in Nike, Brooks, Addidas, Under Armour and Converse. Puma's I wear a 10.5/11. I didn't think Asics would run so large but when I just used their sizing guide, it suggested I order 9.5. So, I will exchange for a 9.5. The shoe is very light and springy, just what I was looking for. I agree with the reviews about the laces. I experimented with lacing tighter but they did dig into the top of my foot. I will know to change out the laces before I wear the new ones.": "4", "They are very comfortable, I run every day and I don't feel pain with this Novablast.": "5", "This is a fantastic shoe with one of the most comfortable and responsive midsoles on the market.  The only drawback with this shoe is that it feels a tad unstable when taking sharp corners.  I really had to dial in the lockdown in order to reduce the unstable feeling.Upper = 5/5Heel Counter = 5/5Midsole = 6/5 (if possible)Outsole = 4/5 (minus one star for instability)Colorway = 5/5Total = 5/5": "5", "Very comfortable but feel like im walking on the inside of my right foot. Been wearing Asics for years and absolutely love them. Not sure why the right shoe on this pair is diffrent than all the other Asic shoes I've had. Will continue to buy Asics but not this particular pair. Right shoe": "2", "I am stunned. I had been running on some 5 year old Nikes. Law student who had lost my way as a runner. Quarantine strikes. Time to run again. 30 runs in, I was struggling to improve. I did a ton of research and picked up Novablast. I was a little nervous at first with this new technology but I have always loved ASICS.Holy cow!!! These Novablast turned my feet into a space shuttle!! The new foam is a trampoline that sends me bounding up the pavement. I legit feel like I am floating. It's like moon shoes or a space walk, I could leap into the stratosphere!!! I suck at running compared to most people reading this, but I just dropped to a respectable 3 mile pace, over :30 second improvement just from lacing up the Novas. Buy this shoe and join me in heaven.": "5", "This shoe has very good cushioning. But absolutely zero under/over pronation support. I have very bad over pronation and when i first wore these shoes, I immediately noticed there is no support": "2", "The midsole with Flytefoam Blast is a great feel and is responsive also . The toe box is perfect ! Some reviews say it is too wide .. no way ! Just the right amount of forefoot and toe space ..": "5", "Been running on these for two weeks now: shoes are decent for the price - lots of cushion which helps with my shin splints. I had to go buy new inserts, the ones that came stock are incredibly thin foam that are impressively useless.": "2", "Good road feel, no break-in period required. Ready to go out of the box.  Fit is true to size.  Been wearing Nimbus for several years and sizing is consistent.  I'll update my review after i get a few hundred miles on these.": "5", "Very responsive with plenty of energy return and cushion. Propelled me to take off about 1 min/mile on my pace": "5", "Great cushion without squishy feel. Nice return energy and very light for a 'max' running shoe.": "5", "I love the FlyteFoam Blast midsole in the Novablast. It's cushy without being too squishy. Good responsiveness from the midsole and good matetials for the upper too.Only problem is that my foot tends to shift and settle inward in a slanted position (with toes and forefoot fitting nicely in the toe box but arch to sole area rolling out and resting too far out on the inner side), causing imbalance and some discomfort in the arch to heel region. I've tried different ways of lacing but nothing seems to help. I don't usually over-pronate or have flat feet. The shoe lacks proper support or structure.": "4", "In my opinion the cushion on the inside needs to be a little wider to keep your foot from filling like it's leaning": "4", "I've been buying Gel-Kayano ASICS for years but purchased the Novablast for a change.  I've temporarily been restricted to walking and find the Novablast great for that.  The cushion is perfect for long walks and short runs.  I couldn't be more pleased with it and so bought more.": "5", "Love the Novablast for its added airy bounce.  Read and appreciated all the positive reviews.  They are right.  I shifted from the Cumulus, which, which I have used for years and love the difference.  I'm a 6 miles a day runner and these shoes have made a difference in leg/knee/foot fatigue.  At first I thought it was just something new, but after a couple of months these continue to perform and provide a running comfort above any other shoe I've used.  Already have purhcased 2nd backup pair for rotation.  Super lightweight, cushiony and bouncy.": "5", "Great Sneakers, Comfy,Light,Quality,Great Colors!!": "5", "have old pair of cumulus size 11 now 11 is to big also they are wearing on the inside sole opposite what the cumulus with same pronation dont understand why so different": "1", "This is not a shoe that will give you great stability. Seems to be good if you're looking for cushion instead of support.": "3", "Walking on a cloud. What a difference from the Brooks I was wearing. Helps with my Planters Faciitis as well. I may get another pair.": "5", "I've been an ASICS customer for years now. These are the BEST pair of shoes that I've been able to run in hands down! The soft foam feel cushions each stride and makes my run more enjoyable. In my opinion...worth every cent!": "5", "Amazing. I have knee pain in both knees. I needed something to wear while running outside since Orangetheory has been closed. Fantastic. Great bounce. Super comfortable.": "5", "Super nice cushioning with superb straight performance and ventilation.  The only draw back is lateral stability, which seems to suffer a bit due to stack height or narrow width..  Otherwise very nice shoes.": "4", "Fantastic sneaker, comfortable, light weight and supportive. I hate to take them off. They really do energize and add bounce to your step.": "5", "Quality is as expected! Comfortable and true to size. I bought them for a gift for husband and he was very satisfied.Exactly as advertised": "5", "These are my new favorite shoes. I usually wear the Cumulus and decided to try the Novablast. They are light and cushioned well. I have already gotten a second pair. Only around 50 miles on them so far. Hopefully they are as durable as the Cumulus. Very happy so far": "5", "Comfortable and makes running less of a chore and more enjoyable": "5", "Extremely comfortable, true to size and lives up to all the billing": "5", "Cozy, soft and light. These shoes are grest for running or walking the fog.": "5", "Longtime Gel Kayano runner. The recent series (25 & 26) had a toe box that was too big for me. The Novablast fits great, and has fantastic cushioning as well. I'm a convert!": "5", "I LOVE this shoe!  Very comfortable and gives me extra cushion since I'm a 6'5\", 250 pound guy.   This is the best ASICS shoe I've ever bought and I will buy more.    ASICS, please come out with more colors of this shoe!  I bought the grey one, but more colors would be great!    Great job!": "5", "Feel great....   Very happy with these shoes.   I recommend": "5", "I have been a loyal Gel Nimbus runner since 2000, this is my first time trying another running shoe and I love the plush, springy ride.  As other reviewers have noted, the laces need to go, I replaced them with round laces after my 3rd run and the shoe is fantastic.  Great job Asics Team!": "5", "I bought these as soon as they came out. I am running 30 to 40 miles a week and usually run in hokas while training for 50k. Multiple hokas have been causing blisters so I decided to try something new.  Out of the box novablast shoes felt broke in.  Asics are a force to be reconed with this shoe. I have over 200 miles on this shoe with no signs of stopping. I will never buy Hokas again!  Just ordered another pair of novablast's.": "5", "I'm an avid fan of asics in general and really love the gel kinsei but these new novablast are by far up there as one of the best cushioned shoe asics has come out with. And the price point is right on, not too expensive, keep up the awesome work asics.": "5", "I bought these shoes when they first came out. I wore them for a half marathon. They are so light and a lot of spring. They are perfect if you are experiencing back pain as a runner.  My favorite running shoe that I have ever purchased.": "5", "I used to run Gel Kayanos a few years back.  I switched fro Hokas a few years back to save my feet from the concrete paths I run on.  Those are great shoes but definitely not \"fun\" to run in.  This shoe is insane, it has all the protection of a Hoka or other maximalist shoe, but an amazing snap and energy.  It's a joy to run in.  I'm neutral with a fairly wide foot, although not quite to EE width. Those fit perfect.  Roomy toebix, snug upper, and a satisfying bounce that was responsive but soft without \"sinking in\" too much.  The over soft maximalists can lead to achy hips for me.  This shoe is perfect, 10/10 Asics, great innovation!  I'm ordering another pair.": "5", "Also train in the Nimbus Lite and so far I'm really impressed with the Novablast. You can certainly feel the bounce as you stride in the heel and forefront. The upper and lacing system just work. There is less padding around the heel and on the tongue but that what makes it feel different than the nimbus when you switch between the two.The ride is super fun. It makes me can't wait until the next day when I can lace them up again.Well done ASICS developers! Will purchase more pairs!": "5", "I just received my pair of Novablast Shoes.  I ordered true to my size (11.5 Saucony and Salomon).  I have a low volume foot.Some of the early reviews mentioned the fit to be generous in the mid foot requiring some tight lacing pressure to make the fit secure.  I too find that.  The step in feel is super comfortable.  The midsole ride is bouncy as they state it is.I can also see how some might consider the ride somewhat unstable if you tend to land mid foot on the outside of the shoe.  The shoe is noisy but not a problem.I would like to see a different lace.  The stock lace is narrow and can cut into the foot if tightened.Overal I like the shoe.  Hope this helps.": "4", "I was hesitant to buy this because of the lack of reviews, but I'm glad I did. The FlyteFoam Blast is great for longer walks and standing all day. For runs, I prefer a more stability shoe, so I haven't tried running in them. The upper is not too breathable, but thin enough to not make my feet sweat. It fits TTS.The material in the heel feels slightly thin, which is fine for comfort, but makes me worried about the durability. I'll have to be more careful in not breaking that part when stepping into it": "5", "I work at an Amazon fulfillment center and these feel great on my feet for a full 10hr shift. And they look great.": "5", "Personally I'll say the shoe fit amazing. Use it to dress nice casually. I also don't have any negative thoughts about it. Great shoes!": "5", "Great shoes.

Also when I tried in stores the 10.5 , Wide 2E worked perfect.One another worst think about brooks is :( they don't offer much color options for the wide shoes - How many years do people have to ask for it - Please Brooks - Wakey wakey and help the group with wide shoes.": "4", "I love these.

One thing I do NOT like about the GTS21 compared to the GTS20 that when walking on wet surface the front is more slippery. Is it the different design of the sole, or is it harder rubber so it wears less?": "3", "Great feeling shoe - easily the best yet. But utterly uninspiring colors. It's almost like Brooks looked around and realized they had way to much white and black dye...and decided to launch a decidedly bland collection.": "3", "Fit decent, but it isn't as comfortable as they used to be. Plus, the colors this year (and previous years) are just boring as heck. I wouldn't dare run in these at night. The reflectors are tiny and hardly visible. None of these colors are visible enough at night (I don't count white, neon is much more visible).": "2", "This is the best looking, supportive, agile, comfortable, stable, and well cushioned Adrenaline, yet.  You have a winning formula for this pair, don't screw it up, Brooks.  Gonna cop a second pair of the all White color way, looks great.": "5", "I've been wearing Asics Gel-Kayano's for years.......this is my first pair of Adrenaline GTS 21's. They're perfect...... I'm very pleased. I'm not a runner, but am a serious walker and the Adrenaline GTS is simply superior to the Asics.": "5", "I have had the GTS 18, GTS 20 and loved them. I purchased the GTS 21 and they have been awful because the toe box is more flexible so it presses down agaijst my toes. There's a weird indentation that causes the toe box to rub against my toes. It's awful. I returned my first pair thinking it was a mistake and the next pair fit the same way. Going to be going with another pair of GTS 20s.": "1", "I usually run/walk in the Ghost 13 and I absolutely love that shoe. That said there are times when I need a shoe with a little more stability and the Adrenaline 21 fits the bill perfectly. The guide rails work perfectly for me when I them. The upper is more roomy than the Ghost and is incredibly comfortable. The toe box is perfect and I love the mesh in the upper. The padding in the heel and tongue is spot on. This shoe is so comfortable you can wear it all day. The Ghost 13 and the Adrenaline 21 are definitely the two best running shoes for me. I love these shoes!": "5", "To be fair, I haven't been able to try a pair of these yet.  These are the only shoe's that seem to help with my PF.  I am going to say that I'm not a fan of not having the standard blue and grey version in width 4E.  They have been available every year, for at least the last 6-7 years that I have been wearing Adrenaline's.  The black and white is ok, but you already have an black version in 4E.  Why would you further limit color patterns for people who have wide feet, by discontinuing other models?  I'm hoping you guys are adding the 4E blue/grey pattern later for this model. If so, it would be awesome to see a response of some sort.": "5", "Upgrade over the 20s. The improved guide rail, lighter shoe, and better fit make it a very large upgrade over the 20s. I didn't think they could get better. Brookes did it again.": "5", "I really like the Adrenaline GTS and I'm glad they are made in wides, however, the color choices SUCK, especially for wide options! How many negative reviews does Brooks need on colors before you wake up to what your customers want?": "4", "Best pair of Adrenalines ever!!! way better than the 20s imo. Comfort and support are fantastic!! Lighter also!": "5", "I'm not a runner but work in the healthcare field and have sever arthritis in my left foot and my arches drop but brooks has been a lifesaver for me I would like to try the 21 adrenaline out because I had the 18 and 20 adrenaline a very good line of shoes 5 stars": "5", "Brooks are amazing. I discovered them after having extreme foot pain. I went to a store that offered gait tests, discovered that I had lost my arches. They recommended Brooks and Hoka. I chose Brooks based on looks alone. Let me tell you, that was the best decision ever. My foot problem was resolved in just a few days. I currently own the adrenaline XX. I completed my first half marathon in them October 18. I'm really wanting to try the adrenaline 21. Maybe one day soon.": "5", "Let me start by saying I am not a runner per se but I own at least thirty pairs of brooks which are worn daily for extended walking, clay court tennis and just daily general use. I should also note that these shoes were sent to me by brooks free of charge in exchange for writing a review. I should also note that I am seventy two years of age. All that said, I find the new brooks GTS21 to be a fine addition to the brooks running stable. for me personally, every pair of brooks seem to have been made for my foot. the saying \"fits like a glove would come into play here only they fit like a foot glove. Two key elements jump out on these shoes for me. One is the ankle stability. when the laces are tight, the foot feels locked in place with little chance of turninig your ankle. the second is the cushioning in the heel probably more important to a walker than a runner but was instantly recognizable. I would clearly buy a pair of these especially a limited edition model which makes up the bulk of my brooks shoe collection": "5", "I am an avid runner and run about 20-25 miles a week. I had to replace my worn out Glycerine and thought of experimenting with Adrenaline 21. It's as if it was designed for my feet! I have issues with stress on \"ball of foot\" and needed a pair with stability and right cushioning to support the road/concrete pavement trails. I would recommend half a size larger than the current size, with my narrow feet, it worked just perfect!": "5", "I have run in Brooks shoes since I started running marathons six years ago.  I have run in both Adrenaline and Glycerin models.  I go for support and comfort.  I recently received a pair of Adrenaline GTS 21's from Brooks for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  I find the GTS 21 to be similar to earlier Adrenaline models.  It is very comfortable and I feel stable running in them.  They feel less \"cushy\" than Glycerins.  Adrenalines lead to a more \"grounded\" feel for me.  Whether I choose to run in Adrenaline or Glycerin, I appreciate the fine quality that Brooks has provided for my six years of running\u2014ten total marathons including three Bostons\u2014thanks for the support and comfort!  I'll be wearing Brooks as my running journey continues.": "5", "In regards to Review the Adrenaline GTS 21,  size 10.5 Men color all black, I did receive these for free to test out the new style of AdrenalineI am an avid runner, run about 35-50 miles a week,  Mainly wear Brooks shoes for running.I can say these did not disappoint.. The shoe is very comfortable and I feel I can run further as I deal with Plantar Faciitis and with the new style I notice my feet did not bother me at all,  enough cushion and padding to keep my feet in place and excellent support.They are true to size, super comfortable, I find even after my run I keep the shoes on around the house and running errands.The only Con would be the color, like I said these were a free pair to try, I received all black, I would have liked color, even if the sole had white on the bottom.I would highly recommend this shoe,  I usually have 2 pairs that I switch out, they are the GTS style as this is the best style for anyone with any sort of foot issues, I will be purchasing the new style for sure.Thanks again for letting me try these out!  I am super excited to continue to run without any foot problems.": "5", "I just received a pair of the new Adrenaline GTS 21 shoes, which Brooks provided free of charge, and have run and worked out with them for the last week. I am very impressed with these shoes. I usually wear Glycerin's but appreciate the extra support in the Adrenaline's. They provide a very nice cushion feel and, overall, are a very fine, quality shoe. I will order a second pair very soon.": "5", "I would like to thanks Brooks for sending me a free pair of Adrenaline GTS 21's to try and review for them. After wearing them for several different activities, I'm giving them a \"Thumbs Up\". I like the way they fit, especially with the guide rails for stability. Also the little extra room in the toe box helps make them very comfortable. I've been wearing the Adrenaline shoes for many years now, and they just keep getting better!": "5", "I buy 6-10 pairs of Brooks a year so when I was contacted to test a free pair of the new Adrenaline GTS 21 prior to release, I was quick to accept.  I typically log 200-300 miles a month so comfort is my main concern with durability a close second.I have worn the Adrenaline GTS 21 for 60 miles this week and have seen an improvement in my minutes per mile and reduction in foot issues, especially after a long workout.  I was initially concerned as the size 13 2E appeared narrower than previous models, but the upper structure of the shoe has more flexibility, feels lighter and is more comfortable than the previous models I was wearing.  I probably will not wear them when trail running, but they are now my first choice for asphalt.  Although I need more time to assess their durability, I anticipate stocking up once they are available for purchase.": "5", "Brooks running sent me a free pair of their new Adrenaline GTS 21 to try out and then give my honest opinion.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They are a good looking shoe and very comfortable.\u00a0 I normally use the Beast or the Addiction as my shoe of choice because of the extra support.\u00a0 \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised at how stable and comfortable the Adrenaline GTS 21 is.\u00a0 \u00a0I typically run on gravel roads or a treadmill, depending on weather.\u00a0 The Adrenaline GTS 21 worked well on both surfaces.\u00a0 It provided good stability on the rougher surface.\u00a0 \u00a0The shoe is so light, It feels like running on air when I was on the treadmill.\u00a0 I am looking forward to putting a couple of hundred miles on the shoe to see how it holds up compared to the Beast.\u00a0 Its fit and look is first rate.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been using Brooks shoes for running and my regular day to day activities, exclusively, for the last 10 years.\u00a0 I used to get plantar fasciitis once or twice year.\u00a0 \u00a0My podiatrist recommended Brooks to me, and I have not had an episode of the plantar fasciitis since.\u00a0\u00a0 I am impressed with the Adrenaline GTS 21.": "5", "Great comfort and superior support!  Best Adrenaline model yet.  I wear these a couple times a week.  Will definitely but a couple more pairs.": "5", "Since Brooks put in the Guide Rail design the shoes are awful.

Finish line is a totally amazing company": "5", "Great running shoe, more for comfort than for for speed.  Im able to run longer distances with comfort thanks to the Ghost 13.  I had Ghost 11 and this feels much better.  I recommend getting 1/2 size larger for more comfort.  My regular size was a little tight.": "5", "I get the Ghost model every 18 months. They are the best running shoes for short or long runs. I wear them also for walking. Good for people with wide feet. They last a long time, too. Excellent color section.": "5", "Love the new Ghost!

I found my toes touched the tip on my older 11s.": "5", "My go to shoe - I wish the company would not keep changing it. The Ghost 12 were the best! In my opinion, of course. Those were 5 star, I don't find the 13 as comfortable, but still a great shoe.": "4", "They hurt the ball of my foot and there doesn't seem to be any support under my last two toes on my right foot.

My only criticism is that I\"m not crazy about the colors.": "5", "Great toe box area, very supportive in step, but heel area is hard- almost feels like a bruise on my heel after wearing all day.": "4", "My second pair in the Ghost series. They are comfortable and sharp looking. I'm a serious walker, not a runner. I would like to see a pull tab on the back of the shoe...that would be my only suggestion.": "5", "I have been running in Brooks Ghost for several years.  Unfortunately every new pair I get, about every 9 months, I like the new models less.   The shoe seems to get wider and have more upper with every new model.": "3", "Funny thing!

They are a lifesaver for my feet, versatile for everything!": "5", "LOVE THEM!  I only wear Brooks, and I saw these in a store, and had to order, but love the Ghost 13": "5", "I used to buy this shoe because it was helping me recover better (less knee pain / soreness) and also was very comfortable.

Very comfortable.  This is my fourth pair. Won't wear anything else.": "5", "I ordered 12.5 Extra Wide. Great fit for someone with standard 12EEE foot. Toe box was the big concern, success!

I also have a wide foot; I wear a 13 extra wide.    When I tried my first pair of Brooks, they provided the comfort I was looking for.  The Ghost 13 all black looks good as well.  If you're looking for comfort and style, I would recommend these.  They're a little on the expensive side, but quality and durability of the shoe is worth it.": "5", "The Ghost is a solid shoe without the weight. In an age of fancy white soled runners that fall apart in a few months, these 'bad boys' will stand the test of time. Hearty lugged soles, solid thick ankle support, and stitched up front bumpers (that's a rarity). I wear a 13 EEEE and the fit is perfect; feels custom. I slid in my personal orthotics (poor arches) and never looked back. Thanks Brooks for a runner I can love and buy again.": "5", "I'm 6'6, and wear a 14 US Men's size running shoe for the most part.  The Ghost 13 holds up to my weight and running style both on the treadmill or on a track outdoors.  It's comfortable and helps my knees and shins hold up on a longer run.  It has absolutely given me a longevity I just couldn't cut with my other shoes due to foot fatigue and pain in my shins/knees.I never really like shelling out this type of cash for shoes, but honestly it's more than worth the money.": "5", "My husband loves his new Ghost 13, his first experience with Brooks shoes. As suggested he bought half a size up and the fit is perfect. The cushioned and wide toe box helps for a pinched nerve in the sole of the foot.

Ive tried every other brand there is it seems and Brooks fits me the best!  The Ghost series has always been my favorite model but I own several others!  The best!": "5", "Gave me heel blisters my first few runs.  I still like them.  They are great now.  I have been wearing different versions of the ghost for years.": "4", "I went back to Brooks after having tried a couple different manufacturers, and glad I did. Haven't gotten too many miles on them yet but they feel great, roll well, have adequate cushion, and look great. To give some context, I'm not a smaller guy, I'm something of a Clydesdale (6'-2\"/215lbs), so I will be putting these shoes to the test. I'm hoping they will last a decent amount of time. I've had other Brooks models before and I've gotten quite a bit out of them, so I anticipate they will last. Time will tell. I would recommend these for road running anywhere from 1mi to half-marathon.": "4", "Much of an improvement over the 12s, which just didn't have a good fit in the toebox for me.  The 13s have much more cushioning in the mid and forefoot, and feel lighter and more snug overall.  Outstanding!": "5", "I purchased this sneakers for my husband. He runs 5 days a week.  He loves them he said they feel light and give hime good support.": "5", "9.5 4E heel is not as tight as I would like it, other than that it is a great shoe.  My 4th pair of Ghosts, that should say it all!  Glad to see they are not made in China.": "4", "Absolutely love them! I was having trouble finding the right pair of running shoes and was skeptical of switching brands. The Brooks online running test made it really easy to pick out the perfect shoe for me. Highly recommend these. Very comfortable  and fit perfectly.  This is my first pair of Brooks running sneakers and I would definitely purchase another pair!": "5", "I felt when I first tried them on the toe box seemed narrower than the 12- seems my suspicion may be correct because I now have a ingrown toe nail on my big toe. Related or not I can feel it rubbing.": "3", "I didn't like it. I have been wearing the Ghost for a long time. They changed something that  hurts my lower back and knee. I have a hard time finding shoes. I have had 5 knee surgeries, bunion surgery, and flat feet. Past Ghosts have been good for me with my inserts. I need to find a new shoe that will be good for my knees and back.": "1", "I use these shoes  when I walk they are comfortable  on the track and the streets  love the colors and the padding in them.": "5", "EXCELLENT shoe for speed and comfort.   I am able to run faster and longer with this shoe. This is one of Brooks best running gear.": "5", "-Using mostly for city and light trail running.-Similar design to the Launch but more midsole-Good, springy shoe.  Good thick midsole.  Good padding in the toe.  Not as fast as the Launch, but more shock absorption-The white color is off-white and could be much whiter.-The blue accent on the tongue is beautiful": "5", "The laces are fraying already! Otherwise it's a great shoe. Performs great on road and love the style. Love the unique laces too, just wish they were more durable.": "4", "As a HUGE fan of the Revel 3 I must say this latest model is quite the let down. I ordered the same size which was too big then a size done which seemed too tight. My heel never felt secured in either shoe without tightening the laces to the max. Every time I ran in either shoe I received knee and side ankle pain. I ended up buying another Revel 3 and no longer had any pain running. Don't recommend if you loved the Revel  3 but maybe it's just a me issue.": "2", "I love the Revel line (I have been using it since its inception), however I feel like this version lacked a little cushioning in the front/toe area of the shoe in order to make it lighter. I have received two bruises and one blood blister on my toes from this shoe, which is highly abnormal for me. I run about 20-25 miles a week, and I have a heavy build. While i do enjoy the weight of the shoe, and the support that it provides, I just don't feel that this version is as good as my Revel 1's or Revel 2's": "4", "According to the friend for whom I purchased them: \"Perfect running shoe! Love them!\"": "5", "Love these sneaks! Super light, bouncy, and sleek.": "5", "At 53 have started training to run my very first 5k.

Happy to run in this Brooks shoe!!!": "5", "Purchased these for my son who needs stability due to over pronating and he likes them a lot. The shoes help him stand upright.": "5", "It's comfortable and fits, but I'm so used to the cushion and ride of Launch and Ghost. I'm glad I tried it, but I'll go back to Launch for my next shoe.": "3", "I'm not sure how you could take a great show like the Revel 3 and ruin it, but you did. These are tight on my feet, specifically the toe box. They also don't seem to have the same \"bounce\" that the Revel 3 had. So disappointed.": "1", "Seems like this shoe is delivered as a \"errand\" shoe. Both my wife and I have switched over from Nike Infinity to the Brooks Revel 4 and could not be happier. For us, this shoe works at faster paces and feels like we are. It working as hard.  I also own the Brooks Hyperion Tempo, but choose my Revel 4 every time, even for track work.

These shoes provide good support and all day comfort": "5", "Straight Fire.... I heard the Revel 3's were a solid Shoe for the value and so far I am quite impressed with the snug fit of the Revel 4's. I ordered the Red with black soles and I love the edge they give, very esthetically pleasing. And comfortable, basically within 30 minutes my foot was fully integrated with the shoe and that makes for a nice feeling, when you take a risk on a new shoe and you nail it......these babies are dead nuts, right on with a perfect a 4.0GPA. Can't Ask for much more out of a Shoe.": "5", "Very Light Weight & They Are Very Comfortable!  Couldn't Be Happier!": "5", "They haven't really helped my feet at all! I heard so many great things about them but haven't seen any improvements yet, slightly disappointed!": "1", "I wear a size 9 in Brooks, Adidas, and other running shoe brands. So far I've ran almost 100 miles on these shoes in about 4 weeks and they are great. Definitely needs a few runs to break them in but after the 15-25 mile break in period I enjoyed my runs in these shoes far better than the many Adidas shoes I've run in the past. Also should mention I have really high arches and tend to train for 5K-marathons. Would 100% recommend this shoe": "5", "Having been a Saucony user for a long time I was looking to change things up a bit. I did literally like three weeks worth of research. I finally landed on the revel 4, I ordered it, received it and tried it on. First impression was, OMG this is like wearing socks, it's so comfortable. I ran in it and again I was blown away. Two weeks later and I can honestly say, this is my favorite neutral running shoe I have ever purchased. I will most likely be a Brooks runner for the foreseeable future. Thanks guys": "5", "I love Brooks and I love these shoes, but they pick up dirt really easily. After 3 wears, they're dirty and look old. If you're purely looking for comfort, these are great!": "4", "I use these shoes to walk 6 miles 5 days a week.  These shoes are so comfortable, the only problem is by 4 miles they start to hurt my heels.": "5", "Love this shoe! Plenty of cushioning and feels energetic. Only problem now is I'm overtraining!": "5", "Perfect fit, first run felt great, second run noticed slight pain on the outside/back of ankle on right side.

Excellent ruuning shoe.Ver": "5", "The bottoms are pulling apart after 2 months of wear": "1", "I wish I could like these shoes but they were shorter and felt tighter in the width as well around the toe box even after loosening the strings. I was glad to get them off my feet and return them. But if the size were normal i would love them.": "2", "not really the 'springy ride' it's supposed to be, in fact RRS calls this shoe a stability shoe which is why it felt a bit 'clunky'. It's also a little loose in the heel fit. I hate to see the Revel switch as it was the best shoe for me thru all previous versions UNTIL this latest 'update'. Sadly, I've returned mine but was able to find the older Revel 3 model and can run in comfort again.  Please change it back Brooks!  We love our Revel 3's!": "3", "This is the first Revel I've owned and I was very impressed. It's a simple shoe that feels bouncy and light with a hint of soft underfoot. The outsole seems very durable and feels great on both pavement and gravel. I use this shoe for all easy and long runs in rotation with the Hyperion Tempo for faster workout days.": "5", "Nice shoe. Ordered because I've bought 3 different colors of Revel 3; which look & feel & fit great. Bought the Revel 4 and everything is fine except the shoes are slightly narrower. I've widened the laces but the fit is not the same as the Revel 3.": "3", "100 miles in and they feel great. Sole shows very little to no wear and still offering the spring you come to expect in pair of brooks. At the price, I might stock up on a few.": "5", "I had some brooks revel 2's and they were absolutely my favorite shoes. Not just for running, but for daily wear. I was really excited when the 4's showed up, but they were kind of a disappointment. They feel like a completely different type of shoe and I don't really dig it. I am sure they are a fine shoe for others, but the major change really bummed me out.": "2", "Quality shoe for what I need (Running everyday 1-5 Miles). No complaints here so far with the Revel 4. Great value too.": "5", "Nice cushy, light shoe. Good upper construction that holds well. Comfy heel, high enough to feel secure.": "5", "I didn't much care for this shoe.

Good durable quality.": "5", "my son has extremely flat feet and had bunion surgery last year, he works part time at a supermarket On his school breaks and always comes home with his feet hurting badly. Since the sneakers, his feet didn't hurt for the first four days. And even when they did finally start hurting, it hurt nowhere near as much as it used to. He says these are the most comfortable sneakers he's ever worn.": "5", "The shoe runs a bit small, but I had never tried Brooks before and didn't know that. Shoes buying in the pandemic is no fun but I appreciate the quick delivery and processing of my return.": "3", "I have the Revel 3s and 4s. Obviously just my opinion, but the 3s are the better shoe, hands down. Softer, higher quality, more form fitting upper; better cushioning; collar is quite a bit more plush; even the shoestrings are thicker/more padded and lock the shoe down better. IMO the only thing the 4s have over the 3s is the looks. And I don't know too many people that buy Brooks for their looks (sorry Brooks). I'm a big fan of your shoes (I own many pairs), and you make some great ones, but the 4 seems like a cheaper, stripped down version of the 3. The 3s are better, period.": "3", "Incredible shoes. Laces were worn though. Would love another pair. Red if you have or black. Great shoes": "5", "My 4th pair. Perfect fit, weight, comfort, and durability. Love them": "5", "Excellent shoe for the road. Enough cushion for prolonged runs, very stable and light. Could not ask for a better pair of runners.": "5", "The shoes are comfortable and they have a energized/springy feel.  I was running in Ghost 12 before this pair.  The Ghost is more cushioned than the Revel and naturally feels better. After running twice with the Revel, I decided to replace the insole inserts with a cushioned insert. That really improved the feel of the shoe and it still has an energized feel. I think I'll go back to the Ghost when it's time for the next pair.": "3", "These a great shoes. I tend to get blisters easily, so I bought them together with some Brooks running socks, and everything is fine! Also glad I took the advice to order them 1/2 size larger than my usual size.": "5", "Love these! They are so comfortable and bouncy. They feel so good to run in. IM a distance runners about 6-9 miles 3 times a week and they are perfect.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe with durable laces. Improvement over Gen3": "5", "I would like to start out by saying that I was not asked to write this review. Nor am I being compensated in any way by doing so. I am writing it because the sneakers have given me relief beyond my wildest hopes.I have extremely flat feet with over pronation. An orthopedic doctor took x-rays and determined that I should have ankle joint fusion. But that surgery would mean zero weigh bearing for 3 months followed by 6 more months of casts and other supports while healing takes place. How do I even begin to decide which 9 months of my life will be put on hold? I have tried all kinds of shoe insert supports that help somewhat but still leave me with significant foot pain.I visited my Podiatrist looking for a possible non-surgical approach that might give me some relief. She suggested trying the Brooks Beast 12 mm drop sneaker. That sneaker has been like a miracle for me. I can walk even on uneven ground with little or no pain. It's the first time in years that I feel that I could walk for hours and not have to be worrying about not keeping up with the family. It's no exaggeration to say that they have drastically improved my quality of life.Needless to say.....I will be wearing nothing but Brooks footwear from this time forward. . . very thankfully.": "5", "Hole in the otter back heal areaOnly had 80 miles of walkingNever again with this brand": "1", "I decided to try a new style of Brooks after I ran through 6 or 7 pairs of Ghost's.   The inside of the left shoe separated from the sole on my Ghost 11's after about 250 miles, and up until then I hadn't had any issues with those Ghost's or any previous ones.  I usually put 400-500 miles on a pair of sneakers before I retire them to yard work shoes and I'm about 75 miles in to the Revel 4's now.  Maybe I just got used to the Ghost's but after 20 miles or so in the Revel 4's I don't feel like they're as supportive as they were on the first few runs.  Again, it might just be that I'm used to a different style of Brooks but either way I'll keep putting miles on them until I can no longer tolerate it.  The shoe is much lighter feeling than the Ghost's and looks great!!!": "3", "Have a pair of revel 4 that are absolutely amazing so I ordered the revel 4. Do not fit the same at all! Half a size to big. Otherwise 5 stars": "4", "I currently started running again and I tried on almost every running shoe in Academy.  As soon as I put this shoe on, I knew this was the one.  I even jogged around the shoe isle with a smile on my face because I struggled to find a great fitting shoe.  I have put some miles on these running/walking and they feel great!  Feet don't hurt after I run and enjoy using as an everyday shoe.  I highly recommend you give these a try, you will not be disappointed.": "5", "DISCLAIMERI received this shoe free of charge to test and review.My first thought upon unboxing the shoe was \"this shoe feels cheap\". It is very lightweight, which is good, but didn't feel very sturdy.  I'm a heavy runner, about 220 most of the time.  I was skeptical this shoe would be good for my feet and frame.  The style of the shoe is unremarkable.  I wouldn't wear them as an 'around-town' sneaker.  I really love the style of the gum-sole Levitates and Cascadias, this shoe seems very plain in comparison.I put the shoes one laced up and took them for a spin.  The outsole is very grippy rubber, which I really like.  The midsole felt great.  I felt no shock in my feet, knees or back, the shoes handled it all for me.  After a few blocks I completely forgot about the shoes and just ran.  My usual route is short, 3 miles and includes half road and half dirt road.  The shoe performed well on both surfaces, the grippy outsole held well on the loose gravel of the dirt road.  I didn't try any true off-road trail running and don't think this shoe would perform well on a super rocky surface, it wasn't designed to.  But for shorter dirt roads it did very well as far as grip and shock absorption.  On the road the shoe really shines, its lightweight design, which felt cheap at first, turned into a very breathable upper that held my feet in place through my wonky neutral-ish stride.A few runs later the shoes held up very well, no loose stitches, the midsole rebounds well after a run and the outsole is staying glued in place.  I've only run/walked on the shoes for about 2-3 weeks now, I'm skeptical they'll hold up as well as some other models like the Levitate for a heavy runner like me, but I was proven wrong from my initial impression, so I'm prepared to be wrong again.": "4", "I'll start this review by noting that I received a pair of Revel 4 in exchange for my honest review & feedback.This is my fourth pair of Brooks and my second pair from the Revel line \u2013 as I also own a pair of Revel 3.  The look and profile is similar to the Revel 3's, but with a few upgrades \u2013 namely, the \"4.0\" and \"Revel\" tag on the heel of the shoe and a reconfigured tread pattern on the sole.  The fit, as with all the Brooks that I own, is true to size and though I've only had them for roughly a week, they appear to be well-made.I initially gave the Revel line a try because I wanted a lighter shoe for my runs.  The Revel hit the mark, providing a really nice balance between weight and cushion. The Revel 4 continues that theme \u2013 they are lightweight, with good cushioning \u2013 which I note mostly in the heel and mid-foot.  I still occasionally work another shoe into my rotation, but my Revel days are favorites as I feel connected to the road when I'm running with these shoes.": "5", "This is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn for walking, the support and cushion are awesome! They don't quite stack up to the Adrenaline as far as running is concerned.": "4", "Great timing with shipping": "5", "Love this shoe. I needed a slip on like this. These are great for people that don't like strings.

Favorite brand. And they last a long time I've had a pair of old rally boots now for 7 years and the bottoms are still flawless. Great quality and personality.": "5", "Nice combo of colors and so comfortable inside of the shoe!": "5", "Needed some new slides for the upcoming season and have never tried Champion for shoes, but i love the clothing brand. When i received them, i was very happy! The size was perfect, they look great, feel sturdy, and after breaking in the stiffness from being new they are actually really comfortable! I have worn them everyday since!": "5", "I love the champion style and the colors are amazing thank you I'll continue to buy it I have 12 different styles it goes with all my t-shirts \u2764\u2764": "5", "I have bought plenty of items from this site and I love every  bit of it and will definitely be ordering again...": "5", "These are the most comfortable slides I have ever bought.

They delivered quickly and great quality. My son is rough on shoes so we will see how long they last! Lol": "5", "Never seen them anywhere..": "5", "I was excited to try these. Colors are a nice quality and vibrant. Doesn't fade with wear. You do need to break them in a little bit for comfort but still pretty true to size and comfortable for long term or short term use. Great for camping, the lake or beach, yard play, even relaxing at home. Goes well with anything. Easy to slide on but doesn't slide around while walking either. I love these.": "5", "Great fit with these sandals - one of the most comfortable pair of slides I own.  The material seems a little different than some of the Nike ones I was used to in the past, but I like how it fits to your foot a bit better.  Sometimes sandals just seem flat and flop around a bit more if they are not more form fitting.": "5", "I got these through a sampling program and saw these only came in whole sizes. I tend to wear a women's 9.5-10 so I ordered a men's size 8. The 8 is a bit too small and a 9 would be way too big. If these came in half sizes, the fit would be perfect. It's a little difficult to review these being they are on the small side so they are a bit uncomfortable. Aside for the no half size issue, the sandal does seem decently constructed.": "4", "Slides were comfortable but I do have wide feet wish they could have a option for a Velcro's opening... or had the option for wise feet... overall I would recommend champion products to familyAnd friends": "4", "These  shoes are so soft  after  I broke them in !

They are comfortable and great to wear by the pool. The shoes don't slip when wet. Color pattern is unique. The shoes are wide enough but not to wide. I would recommend the shoes for female or male.

I am going to buy the black ones as well!": "5", "Love these and everyone at my son's school has commented on them! He's very proud! My only complaint is that he has the black ones and the white graffiti on the foot bed is rubbing off. He hasn't had them that long, but he wears them for a while every day. I was just surprised that this was an issue. Other than this though, they're awesome!": "4", "Accurate sizing and came really fast ((:": "5", "My son absolutely love 5hese, he says they are so comfortable  & he thinks the color is stylish": "5", "they are great for running and walking as well would recommend for anyone playing sports or even just to go for walk": "5", "the thing is you can't hardly put them on and taking them off is a headache": "3", "I love how comfy these are, how easy they are to slide on n off.

They fit my feet well, thank you so much.": "5", "I brought the shoes because they reminded of the Presto style like shoe back in the early 90's, the comfort and the fact that might are narrow and I have a high arch. I contemplated on the shoes for 2 months and researched then for texture, durability, strength and comfort. Now, that I have then they are supportive of my arch and they do not make my feet look wide. I walk in them to protect my ankles as well as my large motor.": "5", "This is a very comfortable shoe.

Always a solid standby. A work in a bar and have always been great for my body.": "5", "These shoes were deformed on the toe on the left shoe and fit like two different sizes. I returned them.The return policy is awful, making you wait for weeks, after they receive it back to the warehouse with no notification of the status, for a refund.I will never buy from the New Balance on line store again as the products appear to be cheap China knockoffs and return service is outrageous.": "1", "Perfect fit, no defaults at all, was finally able to get these in wide width.": "5", "Great product recommend for any buyer trying to purchase": "5", "Shoe looks great and feels great, very happy with it.": "5", "What's more classic than a Grey 574?  Price point is spot on and the silhouette is timeless.  I will say that with a sz 13 flat foot, the standard width worked just fine for me.": "5", "This is a very good shoe. You can wear it casually or for comfort. You cannot go wrong with both": "4", "I purchased size 13 2E like I have on many other New Balance shoes. Excited to find the 574's on New Balance site with my size. When I got them I figured they needed broke in a little, because they were too snug. After wearing them for a week or so they have began irritating my feet and big toe. The 4E is way to wide for me. Very disappointed in these shoes.  Definitely not  the same as they were. Gave 2 stars just because I like the style and color": "2", "The product looks great but this is the third time I re order it. I usually wear size 9.5 or 10, I ordered both and both fit VERY small. I have skinny feet but these still felt tight from every end on my regular shoe size. I think this is the last time I try buying shoes online": "4", "Comfy but you will walk the side. Shoe looks good the sole needs some work.P.s takes forever to get your money back": "3", "These shoes are great, very true to size, and have been incredibly comfortable. I've had two pairs this far and have worn them to pieces due to daily use. My only wish is that they had a bit more inner arch support and ankle support for lots of side to side steps or movement.": "4", "Very affordable, goof quality and great look! True to size!": "4", "I really like them aesthetically! They have a foam insole and so it makes walking pretty nice. However, I would not recommended them for long periods of standing. There's just not a lot of support. Also I got mine a half size up and they fit nicely.": "4", "Love the way these fit and feel. Multiple color choices so they go with any outfit!!": "5", "These were my son's first pair of new balance and he loves them. We will be buying more": "5", "Ordered an 8.5 Wide. Fits well, better than the \"Classic\" Atlantic Blue 574 I ordered in 8.5 Wide. I wish the Blackout was available in Wide. The grey wife's are very good. Should have gotten the core blue in 8.5 wide. Had to check the website regularly almost daily to get these...": "5", "I was excited to order a pair of these classic shoes, because I had a pair many years ago when they were originally introduced. I was dismayed to try on a size 13 and feel how shallow the toe box is on the new versions. I then ordered a 14 and it just felt too big all around the sides. A 13.5 could have been the sweet spot but it was not offered/not available to order.": "2", "The new balance 574 shoes is a great fit very comfortable shoe I would advise anyone to purchase this shoe": "5", "Such a great shoe! I went true to size and the fit is great. Very comfortable and has a nice, classic design. Can't go wrong with NB grey. Good stuff!": "5", "I love my NB shoes, classic design, light, very comfortable to wear and the price is right!": "5", "This shoe is a classic shoe! I used it for work in a retail setting, so I was working around the flat store floors. This shoe offered great comfort, and has held up well. The only complaint is that the arch support did ware away over time due to walking on a flat surface for about 4 weeks. For the price I would say it served as a good temporary shoe till I could save up for the 990v5.": "5", "Thanks new balance super satisfied with my summer fog new balance 574 by far the best shoe I may end up a few more of the same shoe": "5", "Got these shoes and i absolutely love them!! Definitely recommend": "5", "Been wearing these since high school (about 20 years). Never out of style, look good with jeans, and seem to hold up well.Seemed a little small at first but have stretched out slightly to fit well.": "5", "I needed it for work as a nurse. Shows were very uncomfortable and rubbed on right side. Seems like they needed time to be broken into...time that I didn't have. I needed comfortable shoes throughout my 12 shift as a floor nurse. I do a lot of walking during my shift.": "1", "These shoes are great! I love the way they fit. I would where them every day if I could.": "5", "I like the 574s because they are retro yet functional.  They provide good support and the soles have enough tread for walking on trails.": "5", "The shoes i ordered were absolutely what i wanted!!!": "5", "First time I bought New balance and very bad experience with size wise. Usually 10.5 is perfect for me. But NB size is running small.. returning back": "1", "I bought a 10'th standard width size. The size perfectly fits my 275 mm foot. It looks great! Very comfortable and well done.": "5", "New Balance FINALLY has a nice design at a good price listed as Extra Wide (which is supposed to be 4E.) Too good to be true.  The 574 seems cheaply made and likely to split after a few wears.  Extremely disappointed.": "2", "It is what it is, more on the narrow side if I had to mention, this isn't MiUSA quality but I like the look and comfort for the price point of a lifestyle sneaker. You get what you pay for compared to the other NB offerings": "5", "Just buy 'em... Stop thinking about it. Yes, you want them!": "5", "One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've owned to date. The color goes well with most clothes": "5", "true fit and enough space for toes. Like the color": "5", "Some of the most comfortable shoes for me thanks guys.": "5", "How can they sell these when they're so far off from their other shoes? Looks and feels at least 1/2 - 1 size smaller. See photos comparing to my NB 990.": "1", "Comfortable but seems to run short, aid size up a half size.": "4", "I'll try to pick a better shoe next time. First time I had a problem with New Balance, both pair.": "1", "Excellent looks very good and stylish on my toddler will definitely purchase again": "5", "The 574 Core are comfortable and well made for sure!": "5", "I normally buy new balance for work & exercising because this style so comfortable": "5", "Great shoe love the 574 classic colorway can't go wrong I've bought this shoe 10 times over I love new balance": "5", "Very comfortable and has a good look.   New Balance is great!": "5", "I really love these shoes. They are incredibly comfortable and easy to wear.": "5", "I purchased a pair of these online in 4E width, but they were so small width wise I could not wear them. I am a long time NB customer and have and continue to wear the 577, 877 as well as the Breeze and Sweeper golf shoes in the same size and width. However, these actually measured a half inch narrower than any of the shoes I currently wear. I contacted NB by e-mail and phone and they indicated that the shoes were not mismarked and most likely could run small. If you really need a 4E width, I would suggest these are not for you. Otherwise, a very attractive shoe that I would have liked to wear. Unfortunately, I can't give a good rating for a shoe so off size wise that it can't be worn.": "1", "NEW BALANCE 574 is one of my favorites. The selection on the website it very limited and one dimensional. I want the design your own 574 option back. It well worth the added price and wait for the shoes to arrive.": "5", "The shoes are very nice this is my first time wearing a wide shoe and I normally wear a 81/2  9 comfortable and with this being a wide shoe it feels a little bit biggerI would like to exchange them but I got rid of the insoles and replaced them with different ones. So I don't know if I can still do a return?Otherwise they are nice shoes and I like them.": "3", "It is very difficult for me to find shoes that fit me comfortably. These shoe hit the mark. I will be buying some more.": "5", "Classic design and perfect fit. The sneakers are extremely comfortable and durable. I also like that the sneaker comes in standard and wide widths. Quick delivery and I appreciate the tracking option.": "5", "These shoes feel good and look great.  Great design and the color scheme works.": "5", "Good quality and comfortable and colors Is loud and bright red got a complement on the shoes every time I wear them": "5", "Ordering directly from New Balance's website meant that I had more selection ordering extra wide shoes.": "5", "Much like the pair of 574 I purchased for myself, these are too small. Great looking. Just too small. He does want to try another pair. Not sure if I am willing to try,": "3", "After going in to be fitted at a New Balance store. After buying nothing but New Balance. No issues with fitment prior to these. The 574 is about a half a size off length wise. Also off in width. The 4E/Extra Wide is defiantly more like a 2E. It is a shame because it is a good looking shoe.": "3", "Basically this is Only shoe I wear. I used to wear the grey ones but now I'm liking the black ones the best. They look cleaner longer.": "5", "Shoe is comfortable to run in and just to wear. As my running weight is about 125 lbs, the footprint of the shoe is bulky and provides more stability than I need/want.": "4", "I bought these to wear day to day with jeans. They are super comfortable and look good. Cause of mt feet problems they are wide enough also.": "5", "My husband had finally worn out his second pair of 574's and I had carried it around trying to get another. And there it was on your website.  It came quickly, and he said, \"This is it.  It is exactly my favorite.\"": "5", "I use them for everything.  This is my fourth pair of these white NBs.  I also purchased two pair of black '626' NBs for work.  Extremely comfortable but the inside lining at the heel, on both pair, shredded and into the foam rubber beneath in a very short time.I wear them the same as the four white pair and all of the white pair are still in tact, although three pair are worn out,I wrote about this to New Balance but they never responded.I have two pair of the black '626' shoes that are perfectly good except for the shredded heels.": "5", "I bought these shoes for my son. He loved them and said they are so comfortable, fit was perfect, and loved the style.": "5", "These shoes are truly understated until the light glints off the N. They go with Everything! Functional and Fashionable.": "5", "Another pair of comfortable kicks.  I have about 30 pairs of 574s and they never  disappoint.": "4", "Very comfortable casual shoe with enough style for me to want navy when it comes available": "5", "These are my all time favorite shoes . By far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. Never go without them ! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc": "5", "Bought this as a gift for my husband, and he loved them! He raved about it so much that I ordered a pair for me too!": "5", "Quick delivery and a perfect fit, I will order again": "5", "I have always ordered the new balance for my son he is 26 with down syndrome and has wide feet his foot doctor recommended New balance and this is the only shoe that is comfortable for him you guys have a wide variety and great styles": "5", "I wear them to coach in. They keep my feet comfortable while walking the gym floor for a 2 hr practice or 2 hr game..  I recommend them for working or chilling": "3", "This is a perfect shoe for most outfits. It is casual, comfortable, and affordable. Definitely worth the investment.": "5", "NB 574 is a awesome shoe. Fit very nice right out the box. No breaking in. Put them and go. Very comfortable.": "5", "Nice blackout shoe, if that is what you are into you will like. I wear a size 11 d in work boots and a size 12 in these fit perfectly using the rule of thumb (thumbs width from tip of toe to end of shoe)": "5", "Husband has been wearing this same model for over a decade. He loves them. I like that it's easy for me to buy them online and they fit him every time.": "5", "love 574's,  have a green pair and I decided I needed some red shoes so I gave these a go.  Love this shade of red.  Now I need to get me some blue 574's but NB just hasn't released the shade of blue I'm looking for.": "5", "I use these for work. They comfy and look great. I cant stop buying NB kicks yo.": "5", "They fit well and are a comfortable shoe feels like nice on your feet": "5", "Got the regular width because that's what worked before but it was too tight.  Got the wide and it's too wide, but it's fine for walking shoes.": "3", "After my dogs chewed up my NB shoes, I couldn't order another pair fast enough.  Thank you": "5", "Super comfortable!! I have wide-ish feet and these fit like a glove!!": "5", "I love the way these feel on my feet, from the width to the cushion. I have always loved the 574 since I was a teenager, I'm sorry it took so long to get back to them. Good job New Balance!!": "5", "Returned shoes, color was nowhere close to the picture. It's a black and white shoe": "2", "When it said scarlet I expected more red not burgundy. Buyer beware if you're expecting a RED sneaker. The picture of the shoe didn't look maroon to me but I decided to keep anyway and bought some gray laces!": "3", "First of all the issues are a nice throw back and look really good with dress casual pants or jeans definitely a must have": "5", "I got these for work and they are prefect.  I wish it would have more cushion. Otherwise it's great": "4", "I bought these a a replacement pair.  I have only worn NB 574s for several years now.": "5", "These are classic grey 574 NB sneakers. Comfortable, durable, stylish in any casual setting or activity. A real can't-go-wrong purchase.": "5", "Great walking, so I'll wear them while playing golf.": "5", "We buy a new pair of these sneakers for my husband whenever his old pair wears out. His previous pair lasted maybe 8 years which seems like excellent longevity to me as they were his main pair of shoes. We did replace the insole after a while but the shoe itself held up great, and I wouldn't expect more from an insole than what he got from them. I don't remember whether the old pair had the same type of insole this new pair came with, but it is removable and seems washable so I'm sure this will be a plus. I feel like I remember the old insole was fastened to the shoe so we needed to tear it out when we wanted to replace; if so, the new insole type is definitely an improvement. The only thing to note is that, for him at least, this shoe seems to run small: he generally wears size 10.5, but prefers 11 in NB. We did test both sizes again to ensure nothing had changed about the fit over the years, and this was still the case with our most recent purchase. New Balance's policy of free returns makes it easy to save time and hassle by ordering both pairs then returning the one that doesn't fit. Just print their return shipping label, stick it on your box, drop it off at a UPS Store, and you're done.": "5", "I have been wearing NB for 3 decades. I usually get 990 series but the colors are limited. These aren't quite as comfortable but I didn't expect that. For the cost they are much more comfortable than other brands and they have a throwback look without being too retro. They are a solid pair of shoes if you aren't going to be on your feet all day.": "5", "I wear the 574's daily, switching between two pair. I like the fit. I can order any pair of New Balance shoes in my size and they fit. Thee thing that bother's me is the tunge roles and I can't straighten it out.": "5", "I purchased this shoe as a second pair to the New Balance I normally wear so that I can alternate my shoes daily.  I picked this shoe because I liked the style and color.  It has been a good alternate shoe.  It is comfortable and looks good.  I purchased a 1/2 size larger that my dress shoes and it fits great.  I would recommend shoe for every day wear or just a spare shoe to wear when you want a change or to go with what ever you are wearing.  I highly recommend the shoe.": "5", "lam 61 years old and walk a lot i was told about NB by a friend great shoe": "5", "I bought a pair of size 14 and they fit too small, so I returned them, it's been a week and still no email about or refund for the shoes I sent back, I still might buy another pair a size larger but only if I get my money back, hopefully this year.": "1", "Rubbed top of foot bone, so I returned the shoe to NB.": "1", "Size 12 usually fits me, but the top of the toe-box was just pushing down on my toes.  Of course this shoe doesn't have half sizes beyond 12.  On to a different model.  The rest of the shoe felt great.  I think \"running small or large\" or fitting \"true to size\" are stupid terms.  Based on what?  A different model of shoe that fits you but maybe not others?  Dumb phrases that don't actually mean anything.": "4", "These are the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "5", "I like these shoes. I like the fact that you have them in wide width. I do wish you had a version with velcro straps and not just lace up.": "4", "I bought 2 prs of 574s in my usual size/width - 11.5/X-wide. When they came, both prs were way too narrow (i.e. tight) and I had to return them. I found out that width terminology had apparently changed. I now need a width of 6E, which isn't available in 574s. So, I'm subsequently no longer able to wear the style of sneakers I've been wearing for over 20 years. Huge disappointment!! I'd bet there is a huge market out there for people with wide feet. I just wish New Balance would realize that!": "1", "I have the 574's in almost all colors.  No matter what they are comfortable and last a long time.": "5", "Husband uses shoes for walking, and daily use all around the house": "5", "I really enjoy these shoes. From the way they look to the quality put into them. I have feet issues and they do not show up when wearing these.  I got 2 pair because I was so impressed with the 1st pair. Love the retro styling as well.": "5", "I dig how comfortable these are and the visual aspect is great. Definitely a solid purchase!": "5", "Better in hand then pictures i ended up getting the blue pair": "5", "These are a nice sneaker... I love the 1300's those are my favs to be honest. But I must say that I hadn't bought NB since I was a kid, but Nowadays, the new  styles and colorways are AMAZING!!!!! GREAT JOB NB!!!!! IM VERY IMPRESSED AND AS A SNEAKERHEAD, IM ADDING MORE AND MORE EACH MONTH!!!! I MUST OF BOUGHT 10 PAIRS IN THE PAST 2 MONTHS SINCE MY 1ST PAIR IN 30YRS.... LOVE THEM!!!!!! HEY N.B. HOOK A BROTHER UP WITH SOME GOOD DISCOUNTS SO I CAN GET MORE AT A TIME AND WIFEY DONT MURDER ME ;-) LOLOLOLOL": "4", "Quick delivery and a perfect fit! I will definitely order again!": "5", "I love these bright blue 574.  They go with so many clothes and occasions.": "5", "Nice shoes i like the feeling of them i have not when outside with them on yet. But i will soon. I like them very much.": "5", "To be honest, this was my first pair of New Balance shoes ever.  I'm a very loyal Nike customer and continue to be, but I recently bought my son a pair of NB shoes and was sold on trying the brand out after speaking to a very helpful associate in store.  I definitely like the throwback look and feel of the 574 and decided to get a pair.  I love these kicks!!!  My lifelong preference for running shoes has always been a narrower and fast looking profile which compliments my athletic style.  Well, now that I'm older, I really appreciate function and comfort...and these shoes deliver in a way that says I'm still cool in some casual throwback kicks that give a nod to the 80's!  I'll be getting more in various colors for sure.": "5", "The rubber on the sole is super thin these are only going to last 3 or 4 months. Major disappointment because the rest of the shoe is very high quality.": "2", "I've bought a pair of 996s and 327s in the past year and they were great.  The 574 was very tight, so I ordered a wide instead.": "3", "This shoe provide the light weight and adequate width for my foot.": "5", "I use the shoes primarily for walking and just casually doing things in and around our community.  Over the past many years, I have only worn New Balance.  I always buy one size larger than I normally wear.  In this case, I went from a size 12 to a 13 in my normal D, medium width.  The shoes seem more comfortable with one size larger.  I personally would not buy any casual, running or walking shoe other than New Balance.": "5", "I love new balance there my favorite shoes and will continue to order from here": "5", "I love these shoes. I can wear them everyday, for most of my activities. They are very comfortable and have great classic vintage look.": "5", "I wear 9 1/2 and it was a perfect fit. Good for walking around but would not recommend for running. Good arch support.": "5", "Great show for my walking,! Stylish!I would of got the Grey, But the dark blue is cool!My first pair of NB. Love it!": "5", "I have feet that need shoes to have proper support. I typically wear an orthotic because I will get tremendou pain from walking/running due to accessory navicular in me feet.   These shoes are actually working great without my inserts. The quality is way above similar shoes that are double this price.  They remind me of my childhood (80s) which is a plus for me and my personal preference. The only thing I notice (and it's minor) is they seem to slip more on surfaces than other shoes. They could use a new tread pattern but really time will tell how these do. I bought two pair. One for running and one for every day use.": "4", "Love the shoes. Comfortable with enough support. Great quality": "5", "The shoe its self fits some comfortably  I recommend this shoe my friends a good fashion and walking shoe as well": "5", "The 574s are a classic shoe that comes in an array of colors to match whatever outfit. Comfortable and clean!": "5", "I wear this product for everyday comfort. They are a must have for your sneaker collection.": "5", "I like that they offer the wide width . I hope New Balance continues to do so . These shoes are nice to walk in . They are a comfortable shoe and light weight . I hope New Balance continues to have them . Yes I would buy them again .": "5", "Finish Line makes it easy to get the latest.  These anew B as lace are great.  I work in a hospital and don't have an lot of choice on what to wear, so it was refreshing to see these.  I love the color and the plaid lining makes it even better.  The first day I write them I got compliments from the people I work with, as well as, patients.  Thank you Finish Line!": "5", "I love this shoe. Wish I would have got a half size bigger.!": "5", "These shoes/sneakers are soo comfortable, I love them. They do run small, I had to order a size larger than my usual size.": "5", "these shoes are great for everyday shoes and are so comfy": "5", "The 574 run an entire size small in length. New Balance's sizing chart is completely wrong as it shoes they run big, when in fact it's the opposite. There is also significant variation in sizing for even the same shoe model.": "4", "Great color combo": "5", "Loved the shoe": "4", "The fit is true and these shoes are as comfortable as the same-model shoes that I bought several years ago. Fashion purists may be disappointed that the emblem N on the side is cheap-looking leather (vinyl?) rather than a suede that would match the leather on the rest of the shoe.": "4", "Fast shipping. Good quality. Received exactly what was ordered, but size was a bit small to fit.": "5", "Nice, comfortable, awesome color and great support!": "5", "LOVE EM, WHAT CAN I SAY, THEY ARE DISCRET, SIMPLE, COMFORTABLE AND AT THE SAME TIME CLASSY, CAN YOU ASK MORE IN A SHOEDONT THINK SO": "5", "Good with jeans, joggers, shorts.. classic look and feel!": "5", "I gave it 5 stars because it is my favorite New Balance shoe. It is not top of the line but it is what you would expect to get for the price. Very light. Toe box is roomy. I have many pairs of 574's and don't regret any of them. I have a pair of 990V5's and I wear these more often than those. Not that the 990's are bad. These are just an old favorite and I like the way they fit my foot.": "5", "He loved the gift, straight flashback but he didn't remember them having such little support.": "4", "Love these shoes they're very comfortable!! Only thing I will say is they run a tiny bit big": "5", "Good for walking, everyday wear.  Mesh upper of shoe permits toes room and avoid compression of toes": "5", "Comfortable , stylish true to size. First time buyer definitely will purchase again.": "5", "comfortable and sized just right": "5", "I love the shoes I purchased from yall they fix comfortable they are really great so I will be ordering from yall again.": "5", "Casual and Running new balance is the way to go. Comfortable long lasting shoes.": "4", "I love the style, color and materials of this shoe. My second pair of 574. I love the cushion and that they are wide. Plus the price is affordable.": "5", "I like the comfort and I can just throw on some sweats and be comfortable  most of my day. The color on these are sick and the shoe  strings are exclusive. I recommend  this product and many more like it. NEW BALANCE": "5", "This is my first pair of New Balance shoes and i am very impressed. They are super lightweight, but supportive and very, very comfortable. I will be ordering a second pair for when these eventually wear out.": "2", "Theses shoes are very comfortable I can wear them all day long with no problems": "5", "This New version of the model is worse than the Original because even though the label says it's for wide feet, the reality is that it's not, I previously purchased shoes of this exact size before, and when I would put them on they would fit without any issues, now with this new version of this model it reveals to me that New Balance made the same terrible mistake that Nike Factory made before with shoes labeled for wide feet, which is why I stopped being their customer back in 2009, if they don't fix this issue by consulting customers who have wide feet, they will loose eventually a few several hundred thousand customers in this particular matter of wide shoes due to terrible labeling and possible change of factories that manufacture these type of shoes.": "3", "Useful pair for everything. Every step feels so soft and comfortable.": "5", "I used these for work because I stand on  my feet all day and these are the best for standing and walking will be ordering again in many colors": "5", "Wanted to get a gray shoe but didn't want to spend the $175 that the 990 or 993 sell for and the 574 looked to be the perfect balance between price and appearance. Additionally, I have a pair of the NB 574 Sports that fit perfectly so ordering the same size should have resulted in the same perfect fit ... Nope!...these were measurably smaller in every dimension so reluctantly returned them. Will likely have to move up to one of the more expensive shoes that offer more fit options. I don't generally wear a \"wide\" and moving up a 1/2 size in this shoe was not an option since I wear a size 12 and the higher end shoes are available in 12.5. Anyway, loved the shoe and wish I could have gotten the fit.": "4", "Comfortable, chic in their own very special way. I'm totally obsessed. Great for work and play.": "5", "first of all, it is true to size, and ver comfortable, no need to wear several times to break in. will definitely buy again and would definitely recommend to everyone": "5", "Shoe looks great and offered in a 4E to fit my hobbit feet.": "5", "Great looking, and fitting shoe.I needed an every day pair of shoes (in lieu of my gym shoes and work boots) that could offer comfort, and great looks.These fit perfect, there's no heel slip, and it's like walking on a cloud.": "5", "The color is very different from the picture, instead of gray, it looks pinkish, maybe they send me the wrong shoes... but very comfortable and cute": "2", "Seems like the 30th time I've bought these shoes. I absolutely love the new fit and shape of the shoe. Would purchase for a 31st time.": "5", "I love my new new balance574  shoes. They are very comfortable and of very good quality. I definitely recommend them": "5", "Fast Shipping. Great comfort shoe. Runs small. Recommend size up.": "5", "I ordered shoes, the shoes came in the mail. The shoes were the correct color and size, so I guess you could say this went well.": "3", "This is my second pair of NB, love it \ud83d\ude00Highly recommend it \ud83d\udc4d": "5", "Comfortable, but toe box is large so my usual size 12 was a bit big, and the \"N\" as well as the heel tab are a reflective material, which was not (as far as I can tell) indicated in the shoe description, and which I doesn't really work for me as I intended to wear this as a casual shoe and not a running shoe.  I found another 574 color scheme that did not have reflective materials, ordered a size 11.5 which fit perfectly, and returning this pair.": "4", "Awesome product, amazing fit": "5", "This is the only shoe I wear on a daily basis and is super durable. I only have to buy one pair a year and can't see switching up any time soon.": "5", "This is my 7th pair of 574 New Balance. I look for various color patterns that just stands out. Just love them": "5", "Been wearing these for years, love the style and the fit": "5", "Absolutely love the shoes. The fit is perfect and I retro look is what I was looking for.": "5", "Very nice shoe and feels just as nice absolutely a classic shoe": "5", "Super comfortable, well made quality shoe for everyday wear.": "5", "I love my new balance 574 core.  Great shoes for work.": "5", "I'm a healthcare worker and I wore down my last pair of these and loved them so I got a new pair. The issue is that the right show leather clicks when I walk. It has never happened before. Same size as my last pair. I thought they might break in but it's been 3 weeks and it still clicks as I walk. Thinking about exchanging them...": "3", "I bought these shoes for my teenage son at his request. He wears them everyday and they look really good. I was pleasantly surprised that he asked  for NB shoes since he practically lives in Nike clothes and sneakers. Happy with this purchase. Will def buy more NB shoes for my son in future.": "5", "Thank you. Good product. Very satisfied.I will buy more.": "5", "My son loves them. They are so comfortable.

The colors is so cute but basic .": "5", "Good fit true to size good for walking love it will buy again!": "5", "Love these NB, can never replace a classic in style or in quality.": "5", "Bought for daily walking. Very comfortable for sports. I hope that only positive impressions will remain": "5", "Honestly I bought these cause they looked nice but these ended up being the best shoes I've owned in a while. They not only look nice but they're comfortable as heck. Every dollar was worth it.": "5", "Just an overall great shoe. Stylish and comfortable, I will buy again.": "5", "Perfect fit and confortable and great color very nice": "5", "Bought these for my 18 yr old picky boy child and he loves them.

They were exactly what he wanted": "5", "He loves the 574 style. So I got him 5 new pair to go with his collection.": "5", "Best sneaker to get for under $100. Extremely comfortable and the suede is amazing.": "5", "Shoes were extremely comfortable and would be 5 stars, but the color in the photo online was a bit misleading. These were sold as \"burgandy\" and I was hoping for a dark red color (like the photo online), but when I received them, these were purple or maybe plum. I couldn't keep them. I wound up finding a pair of 373 V2 sneakers in the red color I wanted and bought them to replace the 574s, and I LOVE the new shoes. If you like plum, then get the burgandy 574s.": "3", "The shoe arrived and I first noticed how hard the sole of the shoe was. I love NB and have many pairs however this pair felt cheap and the sole did not provide any cushion while walking. Like the all black colour way but I won't buy again.": "1", "Love the 574 its classic design works with most anything": "5", "These shoes are so comfortable": "4", "I bought these for my son he is fifteen and wear nothing but nike .I convinced him to try these and he love them because they are comfortable": "5", "Would love to have kept the shoe but ad to return them just to narrow fit my foot .": "4", "The shoes speak for themselves, the website is sometimes difficult to filter or find certain styles but there's always a live person available and the last purchase I reached out to them and the guy on the phone was amazing and very helpful, he even took my order over the phone and my shoes arrived just a few days later!": "5", "My grandson had requested the shoes as a gift for Christmas. He has a shoe fetish, and wears all kinds. As he took the Christmas wrap off the box, his face broke into a huge smile and the shoes came out of the box and onto his feet!! He wore them the rest of the day. They fit perfectly and were exactly what he wanted!!!": "5", "All good with the shoes!!! Ordering was super easy!!!": "5", "They're more of a burgundy than a red color": "3", "New Balance changed the tongue of the shoe and it is now thinner than previous versions.  I imagine this is a cost-saving move, because why change something that isn't broke? Still looks great, but the feel isn't the same.": "3", "Fits my feet better than any other brand I have tried": "5", "My very first pair from New Balance, and I've become an instant fan! High quality craftmanship, comfort and materials! The size is very true to size...in fact, I just bought a second pair in another color! These 574s are my all-purpose sneakers, and i will be sticking with these from now on.": "5", "Great looking": "5", "Comfortable, true to size, nice look.  Excellent shoes.": "5", "I love running in them and walk-in  and working out in them": "3", "I love the colors and the style of the shoe.  They fit true to size.

These were perfect!": "5", "I have had 5 pairs of the 574 all black shoes that I used for work over the years and these last ones had issues with discoloration and it looked like road rash in certain areas. the prior 2 pairs of 574 that I bought from different sellers had the same issues in the same spots. I was 2 for 2 with different sellers and the same defects. on the 3rd try I bought from new balance and guess what? dame defects in the same places.": "2", "I got these shoes for the hubs.  He lovessss them!": "5", "These are really cute and comfy! New balance have always been a nice comfortable shoe and this one definitely is.": "5", "Feels like I'm floating on pillows as I walk. They are super comfy. And they look pretty good, too.": "5", "Comfortable shoes that look great. Will buy again.": "5", "Bought them for my 22 year old son and he says it's his favorite pair of shoes he's ever had.  He said that the are very comfortable!": "5", "When I was younger I owned a pair of the 574's and really loved how comfortable they were and their classic appearance. After purchasing a pair for one of my daughters, with the strap rather than laces, my middle daughter wanted a pair also. So I ordered a pair and she absolutely loves them and how comfortable they are. These are also being used to teach her how to tie her shoes. I definitely recommend these to others looking for a pair for their kids!": "5", "I believe I would have liked the shoes, but I sent them back. I ordered these shoes from my phone. I hit he size (12) then the width (W), then placed my order. Did not notice when I clicked on order that the size changed to 12 D. When I received email to confirm order I noticed the size had changednfrom what I entered. Your site should have the wide \"X ed\" to prevent a customer from selecting this option. I called immediately to customer service, but order had already processed. I've been ordering NB for years. Will be selecting 993 next.": "1", "The color blue is not as dark as I thought, but the fit great on my feet.": "4", "First time buying New Balance and 574. Shoes are classic and comfortable. Worth every penny. The only complain I have is the sole is a bit thick and I'm still getting used to it. And I wish New Balance will offer more color choices on other models like 1300 and 990.": "4", "Classic, fresh, exactly what I hoped for. How can you go wrong?": "5", "I like wearing these. They are so comfortable. I enjoy wearing them.": "5", "I purchased these as a gift.  Although they are made well,  and colors are exactly as pictured online, the overall fit is too small. My husband wears a size 10 and these should fit.  We will exchange for 10.5 and hopefully they fit.": "4", "Everything was love I appreciate it seriously. I am going to continue to buy products from new balance.": "5", "Thes sneakers are comfortable and look great for a look that is hip.": "5", "Comfortable good quality": "5", "I actually got a pair for myself for Christmas and fell in love with them. And lucky for me, my bf also needed a new pair so I got him one as well and they are so nice!!": "5", "My son was used to wearing Nike Flex shoes and he started complaining on heel pain when doing athletics. We switched to these shoes no the pain went away.  They provide him with better support and no pain.": "4", "Very comfortable shoe not really the color I thought it would be but I like them still.": "5", "It's comfortable and pretty, and the price is cheap, so it's so good.": "5", "I've been wearing 574's for 20 years, best shoe ever": "5", "the best sneaker for going out. Comfortable, true to size and can wear with basically anything!": "5", "I needed slip resistant and this was perfect.": "5", "Great shoe comfort and fit the best money can buy.": "5", "I purchased these 574s mostly to wear to work at the office with my scrubs. They are the OG NB shoes and have a great look. They are also very comfortable for all day wear. They run a little small. I got a 1/2 size larger and fit perfectly!": "5", "Love these classics!!! They are super dope and comfortable": "5", "My son picked these out as a Christmas present so I bought them.  We celebrated this past weekend and he really likes them.  I have to say they are a really nice looking shoe.  I've been running for a very long time and NB always had 'ugly' shoes even though they were great running shoes for many people.  I'm happy to see them change it up.": "5", "Ordered for my son and will be buying more new balances and other products. Delivery was speedy": "5", "Fits greats. I recommend going true to size! Great gift for the Holidays.": "5", "The sneakers look dull and used. I bought the burgundy color but they look nearly purple and dull. They came as though they were thrown in the box. Considering I bought them directly from New Balance I expected them to look fresh and new. I would've been better off buying from local store.": "2", "My last 574 retired two years ago. I've been keeping think of it. Now it comes.": "5", "Very comfortable. I walk 5+ miles a day and these shoes are the only ones that don't hurt my feet.": "5", "Very comfortable shoe. I'm very impressed very happy with my purchase.": "5", "Very comfortable, stylish, fits very well. One of the most comfortable shoes I've every purchased.": "5", "Like walking on clouds. It actually is more comfortable to wear these than my slippers. Lightweight and great support.": "5", "These shoes are super comfortable, super stylish, and super great for everyday activities. I have a pair myself so I purchased these for my cousin as a gift and he loves them. Going to buy more in different colors.": "5", "Quality as expected, very satisfied! Will return in the future.": "5", "An all-around great shoe. Goes great with any outfit, and is as comfortable as any shoe.": "5", "I really like the style of these.  I have them in navy blue.  They are also very supportive.  Many sneakers these days are on the flimsy side and not very supportive. These are solid and fit well.": "5", "This item, I think it is too expensive. I ordered 4X for my wide foot, but I don't feel enough to relax. I rather prefer my old 608 V4 shoes, which is much wider. Toe box space seems enough for long foot. I sense my foot be tightened because of tight middle space. I was disappointed generally.": "3", "I use this as an everyday shoe, it's so comfortable. This is the best shoe I've ever had, and it goes with everything I wear. Its stylish, so it gets 2 thumbs up from me.": "5", "This shoe is great for running very comfortable fit": "5", "Cant never go wrong with 990's v5.Perfect fitGreat for anytime of the yearBest wore with track gear": "5", "I'd like these. I owned NewBalance years ago and sort of forgot about the brand. I was looking for a new pair of sneakers and I saw one of my neighbors doing his early morning walk wearing a pair. I asked him how he liked them. Said they were really comfortable and these were his 3rd pair. He walks around the block ten times every day! I went online and saw they were made in the USA. I ordered a pair in my regular street size usually I have to go up a size. They arrived tired them on and they fit great. Really ran true to size. I wear a size 12. Plenty of support, plenty of room in the toe box my feet don't feel cramped. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.": "5", "Where the 990's every day, love them! Recommend them": "5", "Love the style with my activewear as well as casual attire.": "5", "I love the shoes the are the best I have ever bought but i wish they would make the cooler colorways in the wider sizes i ware a 4E and i can only get those in the basic colorways but other then that i love the shoes": "4", "I wear these shoes every day for work . Very comfortable and I will be buying another pair soon. Proud to say they were made in the United States. Thanks!": "5", "This shoe fits great, is comfortable and I reasonably lightweight": "5", "No need to break these sneakers in... they are so xomfortable and look great on!": "5", "The inner sloe started separating within three days. The hard plastic flag on the shoe tongue is a poor location. The size 13 was shorter in this shoe that the 993 and the end of my right toe rubbed.Over all it seemed like a poorly made shoe compared to my past New Balances.New Balance is one of a few remaining shoe companies that make shoes that more or less fit my 13 A flat feet and I have generally been please with your products and service.": "2", "Comfortable shoes. Made in USA. Crafted better than my previous 860s, although I still really like 860s.": "4", "These sneakers are Comfortable, consistent and very high quality": "5", "For the price I expected more. had better shoes for a quarter of the price.": "1", "I walk 15km a day & have been using New Bakance 990s for about 25yrs.  The size is always the same due to QC, I would think.  Still a bit early to evaluate the 990v5s totally.": "5", "These shoes were comfortable from the beginning. The look nice and feel great. Glad I bought them.": "5", "The shoe is a bit bulky but does what I need, I tend to pronated during my runs and this shoe helps to steady my foot action.  I am also a few pound overweight and find this watch provides the shock absorption which I need.  Overall a good and practical shoe.  I would have given the shoe 5 Stars but took away one star due to the expense of the shoe.": "4", "Comfortable shoes and especially made in USA, love it so much!": "5", "The Only Shoes that I'll Wear for Work. My Go to Work Shoe!": "5", "Stores never have narrow.  Didn't even know there was one until I went online  - these are perfect for me 13B and the support is wonderful -  will be buying more colors - worth every penny": "5", "wear every day use.  You are the only manufacture  that makes sneakers in my width 13AA very difficult to find.": "5", "Comfortable. No surprise. Got the Newcastle, low key color was fine, and they came 1/2 too big so sent back for exchange but ended up returning since I was stuck with a different pair of 237s that I can't return, hundred forty dollars sitting in a new balance box under the tarps in the garage that are way too big and not visually appealing. But 990v5 are ok, may want to order 1/2 to 1 size smaller than normal.": "3", "I have worn these shoes for many years and love them.  This is my first time using their website, but it was the only place the shoes were in stock.  Be careful about what you order!  I wear size AAAA width.  The website only allows you to pick between Wide and Extra Wide and does not relate the those sizes to the number of A's.  I guessed that AAAA shoes were extra wide (with all those A's....)  But, when I received the order confirmation, it showed I had ordered AAAAAA shoes.  I immediately called New Balance and tried to alter or cancel the order.  The person I spoke with was gracious, but said their system did not allow them to cancel or alter any orders.  So he issued me a UPS shipping label to return the shoes to New Balance for free when they arrived.  In order to get the shoes any time soon, I needed to make a second order and charge it to my credit card as well.  The first order arrived, I returned the shoes unopened (requiring a trip to the UPS store) and am now waiting for my refund.  It is 8 days since UPS reported the shoes were delivered to New Balance, but no refund yet.  Inconvenient for me, and amazingly inefficient and expensive for them. I deducted a star for the inconcenience, but feel like maybe I should have subtracted more.": "4", "These shoes are without a doubt the best made I have ever worn in my thirty-two years of living.  Its overall design is perfect and allows me to work eight or even ten-hour shifts on my feet, and then go for a three-plus mile walk, with no problems or pain.  I am without a doubt going to buy more of these American Made shoes in other colors and give the 993's a try while I am at it.": "5", "Have been wearing these almost every day for 7 months and they are amazing. Best running/jogging shoes I have ever had. Fit perfectly and extremely comfortable.": "5", "Can wear it all day!": "5", "Used for walking, jogging, running, sprinting, swimming, and cliff diving.": "5", "The US 990v5 looked good, felt great, but the toe box was slightly too tight side-to-side and top to bottom. I did not feel that it would be comfortable walking in the Florida heat. Most 2E shoes would have fit.  I have sent them back. When I receive my credit, I am going to order a X-Wide, which is a first for me.": "3", "Perfect fit, been buying and wearing for about 5 years.": "5", "To big in the size , so I sent them back and two weeks later still have no word on a refund or a replacement ,": "1", "Unfortunately was to narrow. Waiting for my reordered shoe to come in.": "5", "Excellent comfortable shoes. Perfect fit and design": "5", "nice sneakers but too big wrong size i would buy them again": "4", "looks like poor workmanship especially given the cost": "3", "Very comfortable, cushy feel will use for walking and gym work exclusively.": "5", "The price is high, you know it, NB knows it. You buy them because you are older, you ache getting out of bed, and you pull muscles changing the toilet paper roll. Do they magically transform your feet into pillows of clouds whence you prance around like a 12 year old that you wish you were? No. These are shoes you get when you finally admit you need a good, comfortable pair of shoes that will last over a year, dagnabit. You stop denying you are getting older, and accept your fate. You look at the mid life crisis car in your garage, sigh, and close the door. Accept your age, accept New Balance, and now accept your lower balance in your checking account. Have some dignity though, get the black on black, we're not animals here.": "4", "Timeless style.  Not a fan of insoles, but they are removable so I got my own.  Well constructed all around.  I'd recommend half size down unless you use your own thicker insoles.": "5", "Who knew a 15 year old would want the ortho NB sneaker??? he loves them.  says they are the most comfortable sneaker he has ever had.  They are apparently 'in style' now among his age group so.... fits true to size.": "5", "Shoe is great. Quality made quality materials.  Looks like a different insole however.  The older ones were much more cushioned.  I don't care for this one, and the replacements from new balance are $60.": "5", "Feel great to walk in! Relatively versatile with different outfits": "5", "These ripped out in 2 days. Return started due to the poor quality.": "1", "On my 2nd pair, the last pair lasted 3 years.  When you have a AA width in an 11.5 shoe, the only good casual shoe on the market is New Balance.  They are comfortable and well made.  I wear them daily.  My only complaint is that the shoe laces are too long for us guys with skinny feet but that is easily corrected with a pair of 36 inch laces.  This current pair is my reserve pair for when my current pair wear our.  I should still have at least 2 years left in them.": "5", "I served 30 years in the Army. At 65, I continue to run/walk approximately 30 miles a week. I have exclusively purchased made in USA New Balance for at least 25 years. I do not have back pain or sore knees.": "5", "modification v5 not good.size v5 not the same as was 990.": "1", "30 years old male always looking to stay fresh. I have a big foot and wear size 13 and they are skinny feet at that. I love these shoes and own 4 pairs of different colors. These shoes are comfortable and make life easier day to day at work. The basically go with anything and can wear them with a nice pair of khakis and a dress shirt. People might say they are dad shoes, which they are, but I love them and would not trade my new balances for anything!": "5", "These are of great build quality.  Very comfortable as I break them in. Nice and sturdy build!": "5", "Returned the shoes. I ordered a half size larger and still the shoes where to small.": "1", "This is the fifth pair of these 990v5's for me.   They give great support to my feet and ankles for walking.  They also keep me balanced in my steps.   I haven't found anything better.": "5", "However, there a problem with the toe box, where the fabric meets the leather material over toes.  This should be expanded to protect the great toe nail from tearing/ wearing out the fabric prematurely.  My first pair of 990's had this protection.  I was a long time runner during my Naval career, and have lost good shoes before they wore out.  This is the only shoe I wear because by feet are accustom  to the way this shoe is made and the way it feels when you put them on...": "4", "Along with everything, it's a pretty good hiking shoe, too": "5", "It's the best shoe I've bought for my sons feet. They support his feet so well he not walking on his ankle anymore!!! I just wish they made slippers with support like this!!!!Recommend 1000%": "5", "All I care about is comfort. I use them to get around. I don't run, jog just don't want them to hurt my feet. They don't... I'm  happy.": "5", "After having foot surgery I needed a supportive, yet comfortable sneaker. I walk three miles a day. They are comfortable, but I find they run large. I wish I would have ordered a half size smaller. I ordered the same size as my other Newbalance, but it was a different style number. Unfortunately, I can't return them, because they have been worn. Would I recommend them, yes but try them out in a retail store prior to purchasing them over the internet.": "4", "Walking 2 - 3 miles a day, the 990 v5 is the perfect shoe.  Great support and very comfortable": "5", "I put these on out of the box and went for a five mile walk. They are so comfortable, sturdy and supportive.": "5", "This is my fourth pair. I used them for running lifting and biking. I am a football coach and wear them when I can. Being a size 16 shoes like this are difficult to find.": "5", "These didn't fit just like the ones we buy at the retail location. Good and sturdy, no flashy colors, which we like.They were narrower than the same shoe at the retail location.": "4", "Shoes fights correct to size very comfy and an everyday shoe": "5", "I purchased the 990v5 two weeks ago. Before I had a problem with ache feet.  The 990v5 seem to conform to my feet and the pain goes away.  Loving my new purchased and the great customer service!!": "5", "fit good too high for the shoe ssssssssssssssssssssssssssss": "4", "I love being able to buy shoes made in the USA. These are great for walking and workouts in the gym. My 5th pair of these over the last several years.": "5", "Always the best all around shoe. Have worn the 990 for many years.": "5", "awesome!!!awesome!!!awesome!!!awesome!!!awesome!!!": "5", "Have worn these shoes forever, good fit for me, I feel they arevery high priced as they only last about 6 months support wise. They brought out a grey with black accents for a short time. I got alot of compliments on them but they no longer cary, very disappointed.": "4", "Based on the price and some reviews, I was hoping for a very comfortable walking shoe.  Having bought only NB shoes because of their 4E width, I was willing to pay the price. The 990v5 shoe is comfortable, but not as comfortable as some of my previous lower priced NB shoes...also they are heavy and stiff. Not a product I would buy again, way too expensive for the result": "3", "These are one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. Not only is it American-made, it has better construction than that of my previous sneakers. These have really good cushion and the quality is great. You can feel the difference!": "5", "This is the second pair of New Balance shoes my husband has.  The first pair was your 990v4.  Since he liked them so much after wearing them for 2 years, I gave him the 990v5 for his birthday.  He was thrilled!  He says they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.  I guess they are really worth the price with that kind of endorsement!": "5", "I have been wearing only New Balance 990s made in USA shoes for over 20 years with no problems until this pair.  For whatever reason they just are not as comfortable and have rubbed against top of toes causing pain": "1", "Comfortable and supportive. What else could you want from a pair of sneakers.": "5", "Goes well anywhere The size fits well and the delivery came quickly": "5", "It is hard to find Made in USA; I was willing to pay the premium to get Made in the USA!  I use this for when I go out of the house; church, the store, and walking the dog.  When they get old and worn, they will be demoted to yard work.  This shoe fits similar to the last NB shoe I bought years ago, but it was made in Vietnam.  Size 12 4E width; I previously bought NB in the past and even though the last version was from Vietnam; the USA made shoe seemed to fit similar in size.": "5", "These shoes are so beautiful and comfortable,I will cherish it.": "5", "Perfect for workouts, walking or running.  Love that I could get it in narrow width.  Looks good too.": "5", "I've been wearing 990,'s for many years.  Recommended by my Podiatrist for my foot problems (bunions & neuropathy of the feet)I've tried other brands but none are as comfortable as New Balance 990's.": "5", "Comfortable shoe feels good on my feet and help me to retain good posture.": "5", "My new 990v5, standard width happen to be slightly shorter and slightly narrower than my old 990v4, standard width. For short walks/runs it is OK, but after 10 miles walking I start feeling the tightness, which never happened with v4. Otherwise I like it.": "4", "Not satisfied it seems as though the shoes had been worn.they didnt have the normal packing disappointed all that money !!": "1", "I walk in these sneakers. They are very comfortable and durable. I especially like the wider sizes.": "5", "Exceptional shoe, great quality. Really good for walking and running!": "5", "I am so pleased to be able to find a quality sneaker in my size. My 14AA is impossible to find.  This is my 4 th pair.": "5", "This is the third, and last, pair of New Balance shoes I will purchase after years of loyalty the last three pair of 990V5 shoes all developed holes in the mesh on the left shoe within a very short period of time.": "1", "990v5 is probably the best choice for anyone. 990v5 has own design identity that can not be compared with other 99x series shoes. It's more minimal, modern and simply good design with performance. 990v5 has speechlessly amazing comfort and really stability when walking or running on roads. 991, 992, 993 has very fashionably classical design than 990v5. But not comfortable and modern design as a 990v5. Shoes need to be Form Follows Function in my opinion. As a result, 990v5 is the best balanced choice between Form and Function in any other 99x series shoes.": "5", "Love that I can find a size 15 2A but I think the product is WAY overpriced for a casual sneaker, walking, running casual shoe!": "4", "Comfortable, helps to walk fast, \ud83d\ude0d Its one of the best I've tried": "5", "Good walking shoes.Wish they were available in my local stores.": "5", "Excellent service and product. That's all I have to say!": "5", "I use the shoe for walking and light running. Excellent support.": "5", "I have been wearing NewBalance shoes for 30 years.  This shoe was recommended by my podiatrist.": "5", "This is my 3rd pair. This time I went with the all black. They are the finest made sneakers I have or will ever own. The last ones I had are still holding up after a year and a half. The new ones are so fresh! The triple black is awesome. The matte black accents and the black suede look very classy. The comfort is amazing. They don't have a super plush feel, which is good because you can get foot fatigue faster that way. Instead the cushion and support are perfect. I have walked miles in these and they will protect your foot so well. They also look so amazing. I wish NB would do another collaboration with LL Bean. That color way was my fav of all time.": "5", "I run/walk one hour in the morning and another half hour at night and these running/walking shoes have been the best for me.One comment, I used to be able to thread my laces through the middle piece and this kept shoe tighter for me, however, this last pair does not havethat option and I am a bit disappointed with that because I can not pull laces as tight.": "4", "I have owned several different new balance shoes through the years but I have to say after wearing this pair for a month I can see why they are more expensive. The material and feel are super luxurious.": "5", "The \"Made in America\" line are far and away the best.": "5", "I've worn 990s for decades. Awesome shoe. Always perfect fit and they're very durable. At 6-2\" 240lbs I need strong durable shoe and 990 has proven itself.": "5", "Husband loves the stability of these shoes. He is a 66-year-old off-road runner and walker.  He still uses his orthotic inserts in them but these are the only shoes he buys.": "5", "The only running shoe that fit my very wide feet. It could use a little more cushi, but still very good.": "5", "Perfect for casuals and satisfied with the width and size": "5", "I was able to find what I wanted for size and style.": "5", "USED VERIATIONS OF THEM SINCE THE EARLY 90'S  THEY HAVE ALWAYS SERVED ME WELL.": "5", "Comfy, sturdy, & made in the USA! Have worn New Balance shoes for decades now. I appreciate both the quality & fit - I have wide feet, & they accommodate perfectly.": "5", "This is the 3rd pair we have gotten like this.  The only problem is that it does not come in narrow.": "4", "Love the fresh lookl! So comfortable even brand new and provide excellent support. I took a misstep the other day and would have fallen and busted or broken my ankle had I not been wearing these bad boys... 10/10": "5", "Fits well.  It's hard to find a narrow width!New Balance makes great shoes!": "5", "Wearing these for work sneakers and they are very comfortable.": "5", "I upgraded to V5 - great for walking and everyday use!  Add a cushion pad like the premium cushion CFX  and its just the best.  I found they run a bit narrow": "5", "These are by far my favorite NB shoes. I use them for everyday wear, but I will soon be getting a second pair for running.": "5", "great shoes!

I have never paid more than 70 bucks on a pair though.  But sort of expensive price aside these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned that give me no problems whatsoever and the 10 1/2 6e xx width size seems perfect for my feet.  I have been playing ball hockey in the back yard to keep up on exercise and cardio with them.   I will buy another pair soon.    And I like the fact they are USA made.    I would purchase again and I recommend especially if you have a wider foot or most the shoes in the shoe stores you try on are narrow and scrape your feet weird or cause weird pressure points.  There is nothing like that with these shoes.  these shoes slide on the feet and are comfy and no weird plantar facsitis pressure points or anything.  One really minor grip other than they only had the color grey available would be the laces.  For almost 200 dollars for a pair it would be nice to include some decent laces.  With how great these shoes are I won't let the laces dock a star.": "5", "These are by far the best walking shoe I have ever had. Right out of the box I did a 10 mile walk. They are light weight and fit perfectly. I will be keep a mileage log to see how they hold up.": "5", "I don't like the two color options.Should be more options as this is the only shoe with a EEE option": "3", "It's a great everyday shoe. Great for walking, and very well made. I transitioned to this shoe when the 998 became unavailable. Would love for the 998 to come back in widths, but all the American Made New Balance shoes are quality, and the 990 series is awesome.": "5", "I think 990 and 993 are same sizeI feel more comfortable than 993": "5", "I use these primarily for very brisk walks and running. Great cushion, feel and fit": "5", "I bought these for my son who walks on concrete all day & night long. These were highly recommended for his type of work. I guess everyone's feet are different because his feet hurt. We bought orthofeet shoe, & they are wonderful. If you offer a similar product, I would give it a try.

Something has changed over the years and they stopped making the 990 series and replaced it with the 993 model.  So I started wearing the 993 model and when I saw the 990 model again I decided to try them out.  The 993 model is more comfortable and more stable so I think I will stick with the 993 from now on.  Please don't stop offering XX wide (6X) because all other widths are too narrow for me.": "4", "Thanks my shoes where delivered and in very good condition!!!": "5", "They're super comfortable and I was shocked at how supportive they feel. Also, legitimately durable so I'm super happy with them.": "5", "These are so comfortable and provide EXCELLENT SUPPORT. My favorite athletic shoe of all time": "5", "I don't believe these shoes are as wide as advertised.  I got a 6E and sti experienced some rubbing on the outside of my foot.": "4", "USED AS WALKING SHOE 4 TO 5 MILES ALMOST EVERY DAY": "4", "Walking, everyday. This purchase was ruined because of the need for the customer to lace them. Inexpensive, and easy to do during the productionprocess, but aggravating and time consuming for the customer. A poor money saving decision by someone at NB.": "3", "On my feet all day!! Cement floors, I've had tendons stress, flat feet and over pronation.": "5", "Break them in a bit and they r fire! So comfortable": "5", "Extremely comfortable. I am on my feet all day at work and these shoes let me move quickly in total comfort. I highly recommend them. Plus they are made in the USA!": "5", "I wear these shoes for much of the day, including my 1-hour morning walk.  They are very comfortable and well-made.The only (very-trivial) suggestion would be for the laces to be 3-4\" longer, for easier double-knots.": "5", "I had 990v4 before that lasted a long time. Hope the same for this one.": "5", "My husband has wide feet and Parkinson's - which can make it more challenging to put on and tie shoes.

He said that they are very comfortable and supportive and his feet never hurt on a recent all day shopping trip!": "5", "I recently moved from one apartment to another in the same complex, and about half way through, my feet were killing me. I had been wearing work boots, because I didn't want to drop anything and break any of my toes. My wife suggested I try my newly purchased 990v5s, and I'm glad she did, because as soon as I put them on, the pain started easing up.I've had issues with my ankles my entire life, and I've only found a few (non-prescription) footwear options that actually help - and I'm happy to say that these are incredible for me.If you're on the fence on these, like I was for a while, get off that fence and buy them! You won't regret it.": "5", "Good product, size an issue. I'm hard to fit and, therefore,  normally don't buy on line. All dealings for return and refund with NB went well.

Just the best fit, and the most support and comfort.": "5", "HE ONLY WEARS NB!!! He's happy so I'm very happy fit well.": "5", "This is the only athletic shoe I know of that comes in extra narrow widths, and as a result have owned many pairs over the years. But because there are no half sizes over 12, I have to order a half size longer than needed, and have the same problem over, and over, and over. My big toe pokes a hole thru the webbing just behind the front leather toe plate. As a result, I'm having to replace them well before their intended life.": "4", "I am 44 and run about 12-15 miles a week to support my beer habit.  I have been running in these shoes almost exclusively for 15 years.  They provide the best support for my feet and have put an end to a couple of stress fracture incidents I had in other shoes.  Even though they are your grandpa's running shoes they are still the best for me.The reason they do not get five stars has everything to do with New Balance being unwilling to include them in the majority of their promotions.  I buy two pair a year and it would be great to find an additional deal hear and there.  Thanks again, great shoes!": "4", "I was late to the party on the 990V5.  I overpronate, and these are a great stiff stability shoe.  They're not insanely cushy, but still super comfortable all day.  Immediately bought a 2nd pair in grey.  Well done.": "5", "I very much enjoy the comfort and support the shoe provides for my feet.": "5", "Worn NB shoes since 1980. I have a 13 DD foot, with plantar fasciitis, so only certain shoes can give me what I need: solid fit, good support and the outstanding performance. Performance means good traction on all kinds of surfaces and temperatures. I live in Minnesota where I face ice, rain, snow and heat. To top it off, what shoe is cooler for mall walking.": "5", "Put off spending this much for a pair of sneakers because I had a feeling once I did this would be the standard. I was correct.  These are the most comfortable athletic/leisure shoes that have ever graced my feet.": "5", "Great walking shoes.  Putting on 5 to 8 miles per day.  Shoes provide comfortable firm support.": "5", "My foot doctor saw my NB and loved them.

They are expensive compared to other models or competitor, but they worth every penny i paid.": "5", "I have only the best words to say about these shoes. I have been purchasing these for the last five years. I usually change them out every 6 to 8 months due to the fact that I am always wearing them. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The 990v5 is a newer style but still the same as the proven 990. This shoe shows a little more support at the heal, which I like. I have a narrow foot, so I can order these in a B width, unlike most shoes out there. I also like that they are made here in the USA. Please keep making these shoes here in the USA, I think that is where these out perform other shoes out there. Thank you.": "5", "Thank you!

Two Problems 9 1/2 was a little too big & I did not like the plastic flag on the tongue was a cloth patch from the picture online. Returned them & was refunded my purchase promptly. Now I would like to buy a pair of Mens Made in US 993 Grey & white Size 9 . The Problem is I don't see a size 9. I sent E- Mail to see if they are discontinued or making more in size 9. No one has returned my E-Mails": "3", "So far I'm Disappointed with the initial 2 week break in. Shoes were stiff and unforgiving. Shoes are heavier than expected. Sole Cushion level 1 to 10, 10 being softest I give them a 6. Used daily for everything. Owned some 680s. Those were better comfort all around. Tried the newest to see if it meant better. They are ok.": "3", "I cannot overstate the versatility this sneaker offers. It is fashionable, goes with everything, comfortable for any activity. If you're on the fence, go for it. These are some of the best shoes money can buy.": "5", "The shoe is comfortable and stylish. Proper design and made in America. Carbon fiber around the heel. Suede is easy to clean .": "5", "I was extremely pleased with my previous pair of 990's but finally put enough wear on them over several years to provoke looking for a replacement pair.  I have a difficult shoe size situation but these shoes were much better than any previous ones that I tried.  I went to the same store where I got them but the selection was diminished so I was extremely happy to be able to get them on line directly from New Balance.  The transaction was easy and the shoes came very quickly.  I have been an exclusive New Balance wearer for decades but these have been the best so far.  Plus, they wear like iron.": "5", "I primarily use the 990 for walking, but also use it with jeans and casual wear.  It is very stylish and by far the most comfortable walking/everyday shoe that I have owned.  The 990 is reasonably priced and made in the USA.  I only wish that I bought the gray pair also.": "5", "My 15 yr. old son requested these and loves them.  I love the quality.  Well made. So far, he's worn with jeans and looks sporty.": "5", "When I visited my podiatrist to be fitted for custom orthotics, due to flat feet, he recommended the NB US 990v5. Matched with the orthotics, the 990v5 are the only shoes that I'm able to wear for travel and walking. The secure fit, cushioning and arch support allow me to be on my feet for hours without pain. I enthusiastically recommend the 990v5 for customers who have flat feet and experience pain in the arches.": "5", "Just like my last 12 pairs. Shoes are consistentIn quality and fit.

It goes well with everything!": "5", "The US made is worth the higher price. They're just better shoes, in my opinion.": "5", "I have been a long time fan of the 990's but the version 5 just did fit right for me.  I truly believe it's one of the best running/walking/leisure shoes out there and the ones in the past that I have, I would give five stars.": "3", "Look, I love these shoes. I absolutely do even with their flaws but I needed the hard working people at NB to listen to my review. Within two weeks from when I bought them the adhesive from the suede to the sole became undone and a week after that the threading near the toe box started to wear and become stringy. I also ordered a 10.5 and every NB shoe I've worn has always been a 10.5. Turf shoes, baseball shoes, 574s, x90s, and the 997 all have been a 10.5, and s naturally I thought these would be 10.5 but they running large. Despite these issues, I wear them everyday because I am in love with them. Hopfully you can tell that I am an avid customer and I always return for more of your products, but it seems to me that I received a bad batch from my 990v5 which had hurt my new balance experience. I would love to buy another wonderful pair of these shoes to make up for the imperfections, but the price tag is steep and so perhaps next year I may return with a better review like the majority of these reviewers.": "2", "I had the previous model, worked great. I bought this model expecting the same. After having the shoes for about 7 months, which is actually a great amount of time, but for a shoe this price is bad, the toe box detached from the sole of the shoes and the foam seemingly disintegrated. It was wack, didn't really understand how it happened.  Not one star because the shoe is comfortable and lasted more than 6 months. Barely made the cut g.": "2", "Great performance for run and walk, and stylish also": "5", "Have used these for years. Great shoes.Very expensive.Insoles wear out before shoes.

They offer great comfort and support. I am able to use my orthotics with little problem. I do wish that New Balance would fiddling with them each year but I guess they are trying to improve them.

The width of this shoe is wider than previous models, in regards to the narrow \"B\" width.": "4", "This is one of several 99x series of shoes I've owned, and each pair have been very good (all were primarily sourced/made in the USA).  That's why I keep buying these. I especially like the black that came out this year, and looking forward to a year or more of service.": "5", "Fits well, comfortable, and durable.  Highly recommended!": "5", "so nice shoes. comfort and good to wear": "5", "One of the highest quality sneakers out there. Unlike most shoes at this higher price point, you actually get a build quality that justifies the price.Take both size and width into consideration and get the one that works best for you. I have a narrow foot and tried ultra narrow first and switched to narrow, which works better. Most shoes don't offer this kind of specificity.Bring back the v3!": "5", "Quality and comfort go hand in hand with this fabulous class act.

Great for running walking or working out I'm from Washington DC and we wear them for fashion as well.": "5", "I've worn NB 99X series shoes since the early 90's. They have always fit to size, with little to no period of breaking the shoes in. The comfort level is top tier and long lasting. I used to use these for running. In recent years I switched to power walking (better for the knees at my age) and still wear these. I have never found another model of shoe with better support. I also use a second pair for casual use. For comfort and support, you can't beat these. Also, the treads work well. You are not as likely to slip and fall in these as you would be in a cheaper show. Everything I just wrote applies  to the 990v5 model that I just purchased and am writing this review specifically for.": "5", "The best, made in US, shoes I've ever owned!

I prefer these running shoes because they come in an extra wide width that I require, afford fine comfort, and are durable.  Importantly, they are made in the USA, something for which I will pay a premium.": "5", "Seam on side of shoe different than other 990 I have owned. Created pressure on side of foot causing blister": "2", "Upon a recommendation from my podiatrist, I have been wearing the 990 since 2008. I suffered from plantar fasciitis and my doctor recommended these to alleviate the pain. Not only did it remedy the pain but I no longer have plantar fasciitis.

Always good fit.": "5", "I wear it almost everyday. Very comfortable. :D thx": "5", "This is my second set of 990's and I will likely continue to purchase these shoes.

Every two months I would wear holes in the mesh. Contacted customer service and provided no help.  Disappointed in the quality.": "1", "I've been wearing the 990s for over 15 years by far the greatest sneaker ever.": "5", "I just bought a triple black pair, and these grey 990v5's. The triple black are going to be used for work, and the Grey for leisure and walking. I have a few more pair on the way. I'm swapping out my other sneakers with all New Balance USA made products. The 990's feel slightly larger than the same size Nike, which really equats to a more comfortable shoe in the same size 11. Not enough to go down a 1/2, just room to actually move the toes around a little...just more comfort. Very well built, and surprisingly light weight.....great shoes. Some Burgundy 990v5's would be great !!1...lol": "5", "I love this shoe and have been wearing it for over 13 years - constantly. The only problem is that because of Covid, I couldn't obtain the all black. Too bad. This color gets dirty a lot easier.": "4", "First pair of New Balance, and I've heard a lot of good things about the 990v5. I purchased a size down from my overall shoe size, which a lot of people recommended. Also went with the wide option because other brands tend to fit snug in width for me, and I have very low to no arch. I can say for myself that the standard width would've worked just fine. They felt great to try on, but there was a LOT of width for me, especially in the arch area. I felt like it wouldn't of provided much support if I kept them and laced them tighter. I ended up shipping them back and reordered in a standard width. I'm a fan. Cant wait to get them in.": "5", "I am a New Balance person since the early '90s. I am impressed with the forward technology of this shoe. Being a bka, it is extremely important to find shoes to serve multiple purposes. I highly recommend and stand behind the New Balance brand. Fits great, looks good and color choices always fit my mood.": "5", "Most Comfort for a shoe that I have for awhile. Very satisfied. Thank you for such a good sneaker.": "5", "I've been wearing \"990s\" for many years. I'm now 85 and walk about 5 miles a day, staying in shape to compete in Senior Olympics. I've tried other shoes, but never for my \"go to\" brand and model.": "5", "I've run in the 990 series on and off for decades. I currently own the 990V1 bring back (original 990), 993s, and now the 990V5. I'm one of those people who still put this shoe series in my running rotation since there are so few true stability shoes left that help keep me from injury.  For the most part this shoe has maintained its traditions in fit, feel, and function.  However, in my size of 11.5 US , the shoe has grown to 16 ounces which is getting pretty heavy for even a legacy running shoe line.What I Like:Same 990 fit with even a slightly wider toe box than the 993,  good midfoot lock-down and comfortable heel.  midsole is good balance of stability and cushioning (slightly softer than 993 with more absorb and more compliant Encap), durable outsole that should last many miles. Made in USA.What I don't like:In my size these shoes are 2 oz heavier than the 990V1 and 1 oz heavier than the 993.  Bulk in midsole could be lost and power straps could be made to be lighter or removed.  No reason for this shoe line to continue to increase in weight.  Forefoot is not nearly as flexible as 993 which is noticeable in my gait.  Most NB running shoes have slight cut outs in outsole flex points to aid in flexibility.  These do not.  Not sure if I like that they are softer than 993 or not since stability is sacrificed a bit.Bottom line:If you want a shoe that really feels like the 990 series did for many years, buy the 993 instead.  If you want a shoe that's very comfortable and a little softer than the 993 and don't care about the extra weight, then this is your shoe.   I'm hoping NB takes this shoe and shaves an ounce back off for the V6 in the future keeping it as a viable running shoe.  For me that extra ounce makes a difference.": "4", "Ok shoes,it's not the best and comfortable shoes.And it's not soft nor running shoes.": "3", "Great fit.  Thank you New Balance for making a range of widths.I like everything about the  shoes except the white smiley-face stitched into the upper toe area": "4", "Try to find a more comfortable, stylish shoe... we'll wait. 990v5's are exceptional in every category and the quality of the materials is absolutely worth the sticker price. The materials used should absolutely embarrass Nike and Adidas. These will LAST as long as you take care of them. I love these shoes to death and they compete for some of my favorites in my collection that I wear on a regular basis. I plan to always have a pair of 990's in the closet.I would recommend going down .5 size as the toe box is quite spacious.": "5", "Received the pair of the 990'sWearing them around the house to break them in.  Looking forward to using them for my daily walks.": "4", "Love my new shoes so comfortable and it's hard to find a xxl wide shoe. The best thing about buying them is they are made in USA": "5", "My husband wears a size 15 shoe. He's worn this same shoe for years and needed a new pair. Finding size 15 shoe can be a nightmare.

Still haven't received refund.": "1", "I needed an all-around athletic shoe for aerobic workouts, occasional tennis, and casual wear. The 990v5 does all well. They were incredibly comfortable straight out of the box -- no break in. Solid cushioned support with no tendency to roll.": "3", "I liked my first pair so well I bought the same shoes again. I work and play hard and am tough on shoes. These hold up very well and are pretty darn comfortable, especially at the end of the day or when I am traveling.

It is Super Comfortable with  Great Styling and Look.": "5", "I'm not a runner....more of a neighborhood walker and heavy gym user. These shoes just seem to work great on my size 13 flat feet. When you reach your mid 40's, you realize how much shoes mean to your overall well being. Yes, these are pricey but they feel amazing on my feet and offer a smooth, comfortable, and stable ride. I get a new pair every 3-4 months and will use the old pair to cut grass in. I also like the conservative look very much.

The prices as has changed but the love for a pair of Nike Air Force Ones hasn't. At 19 i use to cop 2 pair (no thanks to Nelly) but as i older i slowed down on doing that.

This girl is happy!! Such a classic look!!": "5", "Got it for my nephew and he really loves it. He wears it everyday.": "5", "Obviously a classic silhouette that every person needs in their wardrobe. Looks great on feet but don't expect any crazy amount of comfort. Leather squeaked out of the box but lubrication solved the problem as well as breaking them in more. Toe box creases easily so I would recommend purchasing crease guards as well. Overall happy with my purchase.": "4", "I also wish the mid had strapping like the high top.

When I first put it on I had a bit of trouble actually getting it on my foot. And the super long laces that hang over your foot and to the ground are annoying but if you just tuck them it it's fine. The shoe fit very comfortably once I got it on. I don't want to say it was super small but I'm usually a 8 and 1/2 and when I got these I had to get a size 9, so they were a little small for me. Good shoe": "5", "I love the style of shoe but I would NEVER recommend purchasing from Finish Line. It took 3 weeks and 7 phone calls before I actually received my order!

I was just in high school when Air Force Ones deputed. This shoe and the color brings back memories and times I miss. This shoe still relevant after all these years. I'm headed to 50. My grand kids n kids rock AF1's lol. Cmon Man. That's Killin the game!!!!!!!": "5", "I'm just a AF1 man. Like the different colors they come in. Love the fit. Now please come out with the all green mid.Thanks guys,": "4", "First of all, I ordered two pairs of kicks and only one came. I ordered the AF1s for an event, and lo and behold, they didn't show up in time because someone at Finish Line failed to put them in the shipping box! Really? As for the shoe, it's good looking, but it rubs my ankle something fierce. Maybe that will change during the break-in period, but for now, it's annoyingly uncomfortable.": "3", "I only received one shoes when my package came. I'm thinking about ordering my future shoes from another website": "1", "Nice shoe for a nice price thanks finishline for a great purchase.": "3", "I bought the off white color because it was a deal I couldn't refuse.

Great deal on this site!": "5", "I purchased the shoe for back to school for my son but I think I should have went up a size due to the shoe is very narrow.

I have two pairs and i get compliments each time i wear them": "5", "Excellent shoes, very comfortable, but they run a size big I will probably buy more of these shoes": "5", "Thank you I love shopping with you guys for the family.": "5", "Bought these shoes for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. The colors add to the perfect style of these mids. I love them in every color.": "5", "The edges where the sole comes together with the shoe was poorly crafted. You can see glue residue on it still.

Sweet!!!!!": "5", "I copped the AF1 in all-black so I could have an all-black pair of kicks. True-to-size in fit. Surprised that they actually feel like mid-tops when they look like high tops. Time to get a second colorway.": "5", "Can't go wrong with a pair of these... one of the only brands I buy over and over. Absolutely love them.": "5", "Overall this is a great shoe. The all white goes with just about anything! I did have to go half a size down. I wear a 10.5 and I had to get a 10. But these will never grow old. Always love to Nike.": "4", "Very Comfortable, the white is a true-VERY-white...awesome shoe!!": "5", "I don't choose any other shoe. This is my favorite brand and style of shoe.

I highly recommend these Air Forces by Nike.": "5", "Air Force Ones never go out of style and they ar an all around great quality shoe! I been wearing them for decades.": "5", "I recently purchased all white Air Force 1's from Finish Line in early February. Prior to purchasing them, I had been looking for these shoes online and in stores for about 4 months. Shoe stores either did not have my size or were sold out, and online shoe stores sold them way over priced. I had almost given up on my search when I discovered that Finish Line not only had Air Force 1's in stock, but had my size! The shoes were also very affordable in comparison to other online stores that were selling them for $50 over Finishline's price. I instantly ordered them! Anxious to receive the shoes, I paid a little extra to receive them within a few days. To my surprise Finishline delivered them very quickly and I received them sooner than expected! I've had my shoes for over a month and really love them! As Air Force 1's have made a come back in the street style seen Ive received a lot of compliments on them, and have been asked where I purchased them because a lot of cats have been looking to buy a pair also. I live in Santa Cruz so the men's shoe game is really limited. At times I'm skeptical about sharing where I ordered my shoes from out of fear that they'll run out, but at the end I recommend them to look at Finishline. The quality is great, and the fit is just right. They are equally as comfortable as previous times that I have bought them. I'm sure once I wear these out, I'll buy some new ones.": "5", "Nothing like the all white Air Force Mid, but these are sick and go with everything..": "5", "These are excellent shoes yes a little old school but I have bought atleast 4 pairs of these they are realy comfortable and stylish match almost anthing": "5", "Great classic shoe...and the price was nice!!": "4", "I was not able to find this show in my size at the store so I was very happy to find it online and on sale!

I named them my swagmisers. :) The end.": "5", "I have always baught the nike air force one it is a shoe that would never go out of style... I like the way it looks and the comfort....Nike always delivers": "5", "I got them a while ago and I love them! they go with everything also they clean well! but it did start to fall apart on me after about a year": "5", "Air Force 1's are a timeless classic. In terms of a basketball shoe the 31 year old technology is outdated for today's standard. Whereas as a casual shoe you can't really go wrong, the shoes simple design can go with any outfit albeit shorts or jeans. Color there are so many different colorways that you cannot find any color that won't matchup. Over the years the leather quality has gone down a bit but the shoe is still very durable.": "4", "I love them! The price was awesome and they arrived wayyyy quicker than said.

I ordered a size larger then what I normally wear but when I got them they fit smaller then what I already have. I thought i ordered the wrong gender shoe and started looking to see if they were a woman's size 11 shoe or maybe a kids shoe because they are extremely tight on my foot and my toe is pressed against the front of the shoe.but my online invoice states mens size 11 shoe, same with in the shoe and on the shoe box.I love the pair I currently own, this is why I purchased another pair but now I'm hesitant on buying another pair. This has nothing to do with finishline.... i buy all of my shoes here . Just a mis label or something ....very confused.

Not my first pair however my older huaraches had the pull tab to help put them on and these don't. That's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 it's a little bit of a hassle to put on": "4", "The shoes run maybe a half size small but I expected that with huaraches so I always buy a half size larger. the width is medium all depends on how you lace your sneakers as well , they look awesome and clean . Great for casual wear of when your out to the gym !": "4", "This is the perfect shoe , both fashion forward and comfy , and the price you can't beat . No Matter what time of the year , or what the dress code is , this shoe gives you great versatility. A classic old school brand with a new age twist": "5", "I don't know if all the boost and react foam has warped the way I think about comfort. (puma's hybrid system is my favorite, it's more stable on my heel/foot)These shoes hurt my very flat feet, to the point that more than a couple hours in them and my feet start cramping up. Stiff support, not like foam or boost at all.I will also echo that they are really hard to get on, once they are on the upper is very comfortable, shame about the soles being so hard and stabby in the middle of my foot.": "2", "These shoes are absolutely the most comfortable walk/run shoe I own. I did not have to break them in at all. I did have to order a half size up to get a more comfortable fit.": "4", "I bought these online for my brother with special needs. He LOVES red Nike shoes and I get him a new pair every year for xmas. It is so hard to tell from the picture but the opening is super small. They don't unlace to loosen so you can put your foot into them, the tongue is completely attached to the rest of the shoe. Someone with great dexterity may have no issues putting these on, but not someone who is challenged a bit with dexterity. Exchanged these for him for a more user friendly pair.": "2", "Initially I bought these because they were so cheap and I never owned a pair before. But I also noticed the reviews said they were very comfortable so that also persuaded me to make the purchase.

This last bout I had a different pair but had to exchange them for a different size (which was out of stock) and ended up with the 2015. I was weary because of the way the air pocket is on this shoe and for good reason. My practically brand new shoe air pocket lost its air after only wearing them (maybe) 10 times. Upon trying to exchange them the return policy only allowed 60 days and it had been 65. Due to whats happening right now there was no way to speak to someone so I could inquire about exchanging them.

They looked used when I received them. One sneaker wasn't stuff with tissue or cardboard and the other has very little tissue only they weren't wrapped in tissue either. They looked like someone just took them off of their feet, put them in the box and sent them to me. I was excited receive them and wear them to a upcoming outside party but no such luck! Finish line's customer service was less than understanding and in my opinion did not try to accommodate me for their mistake. They wanted me to rush to UPS to return them in order for them to send me a new pair as if I don't work and have a homeschooling child at home. I just wanted a replacement pair to be sent asap because as I said I wanted them for a upcoming outside event, and I didn't want them to sell out. I would have returned these on the weekend. It's not like they didn't have my information.  They could have charged me for the second pair if I didn't return the first pair.

Love wearing them out on walks.": "5", "These kicks are pretty sweet. I had been eyeing them for a while. Since I  am a size Sasquatch I had to order a men's size 8.5 which was ok because I like the colors. The no tying mechanism is really cool.

Definitely pricey but worth it!": "5", "It's just so comfortable": "5", "I went on a weekend trip with 3 girlfriends.  We hit 7 States in 72 hours.  When we were in Washington DC on a walking tour of the city.  It seemed like I was walking on clouds the entire time.  We clocked over 15,000 steps and my feet were as comfortable as could be.

I was so excited for these.": "1", "No doubt they are upper echelon nikes top tier- traffic stopping comments/looks. They take a minute to break in.

I'm used to carbon fiber boots on my speedskates which are molded to my feet. These shoes are as snug. Interesting tid bit. These squeak. Every step on every surface lol.

These felt like I was secure and not all wobbly (and this coming from a big dude (6'4\" / 350lbs) plus just all around comfy. Now I'm not using these for my workout shoes - more just out and about ones. But definitely suggest as Nike continues to only improve on these": "5", "These are super comfortable and look great on foot :)! I was kinda skeptical and tried on in-store and these were an instant cop.They're more comfortable than the OG vapormax shoes and have some subtle improvements that justify the price increase, the insole adds some extra comfort as well.I got the black pair with the teal swoosh and these look crazy when the sunlight hits them!Get em true to size in my opinion i'm a size 12 in most Nikes and these fit great.": "5", "I needed a pair for the gym and casual use.

Arrived with no issues and a day early would definitely do it again.": "5", "The looks of the shoe were great unfortunately I had to take back to store because I have a wide foot and they only are made in medium width and I tried to get a half or whole size larger but they had none in stock so ended up going with little different style vapormax but for most part I like the line of show very comfortable and form fitting just make sure if you are a man or woman and have a wide foot you get a half to 1 size larger": "3", "The color black color on these shoes makes them look way more premium the the other shades imo, when you add the infrared and gold highlights on the tongue it takes it to another level.": "5", "The reason I bought the shoe was to go running and I am enjoying every mile I run. They are comfortable, light and pretty cool to look at.": "5", "My boyfriend loves these shoes! He now has them in almost every color. I will continue to buy because he's super picky about shoes he works in.": "5", "Initial assumption very good looking shoe but when tried on I found you need a full size more then what you wear regularly they are made for people who have small to medium width feet": "3", "It is a little narrow but still comfortable,  feels like a sock to me.

A few weeks in and I'm loving the feel and the versatility of this shoe. Not as fast as some of the previous Nike speed shoes but definitely a new innovative take on the Pegasus line up. If you've had any of the previous iterations you'll love this model. I mainly use it for everyday runs and if I throw in some tempo I can definitely pick up some speed. This looks like it'll be good on mileage and also a great compliment to the Nike vaporfly next percent and alpha fly. Would absolutely recommend.": "5", "Dope shoes": "5", "The updated Pegasus have the rare combination of being super cushy and forgiving, but very responsive and fast. From the second I put these on I wanted to cut loose, I felt like they were almost going to run by themselves. Before these, as I pushed my distance further and further I had trouble with ankle pain and my training suffered. Now equipped with the right shoes I have comfortably increased my long run distance, and haven't suffered through next day recovery runs with ankle pain. I've also instantly improved my average mile times by a solid 15 seconds. Super forgiving on downhills also, allows you to pick up a lot of time without worrying as much about injury. I actually sank my entire foot in a snow melt puddle within minutes of my first run with these, and continued to finish out a 8.5 mile run with no issue! No rub, no slip, no hot spots. Totally amazing. Ran a little small for me so I sized up a half size.": "5", "This is my multi-purpose workout shoe. I wear it to run, lift weights and play tennis.

My only complaint is that the white color is almost opaque.": "4", "We use the shoes for running and working out and I must say there the best I've ever had on my feet. Great product.": "5", "I have skinny feet, these fit perfect/true to size for a size 12.  They look so sharp, several folks have complimented them while I'm out walking.

Sole is a little more firm and bouncy so it works well for all the dog walking I do =)  Would definitely like to buy another pair when these get worn out.": "5", "These shoes look amazing and feel very bouncy.

This would be my choice for a marathon training shoe or even for race day.": "5", "Good for running and walking": "5", "These are the only neutral running shoes in my rotation that aren't trail running shoes. You can really feel the Zoom airbag in the forefoot; it's springy and reactive, I really enjoyed version 36: this improvement in cushion is exactly what it needs.I really like the valerian blue and volt color way: simple and elegant.Might seem as if the ankle slips but I find that sensation improves as you run.This is not a stability or motion control shoe: for that I turn to the React Infinity Run for longer work.": "4", "I was hoping to get something to wear and I received something better a lot better!Excellent buy it worth every penny": "5", "I could give them 5 stars but I don't use them for running. I can't say they are the best cause I haven't had anything to compare to. I use them for working in a warehouse, and up to this date they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever used.": "4", "I have plantar fasciitis so a well built shoe is a must everyday. Like with every one of my shoes, I replace the insert with my own and these Pegasus 37s are my go-to everyday shoes, hands down.

Had the 36's which were my first real running shoe as far as for distance. Great shoe, this shoe is great as well but I do have some heel slippage which eventually I get use to. I can do my long runs in these at a slow or threshold pace. Great all around shoe.": "5", "Love the shoe. Super comfortable and it really feels like you're walking/running on clouds!!": "5", "I use them to run but also for everyday casual use.  Very comfortable and supportive.

I love the cushion and they are very light. Best pair of running shoes I've had. Recommend them for anyone that loves running.": "5", "I feel like a kid saying, \"look how fast my new shoes are!\"  But it's true!  These things are crazy fast.  And they conserve energy so you have more left at the end of your runs.  I always buy size 11 in Nike, and these were no different.  Size 11 fit perfectly.": "5", "Great fit and comfort.  The rear and forefoot zoom cushion is awesome!": "5", "I love this shoe!  I have two pairs and I run 3.5 miles 4 times per week.  I weigh 200 lbs, so I go through shoes pretty quickly.

Great cushioning, light weight, and they feel like they propel me.": "5", "Considering the weight of these shoes, they do have a good amount of responsiveness on my speed and tempo runs. I've used them on long runs as well and they perform fairly well. Great counter partner to the Alpha Fly.": "5", "A lot of walking, great for running/walking, training and exercising, don't see anything negative about the shoes, comfortable fit": "5", "This is the perfect trainer shoe for higher mileage to pair with the Alphafly Next%. This shoe has all the goods of the Alphafly but much more capable for all your training miles. The Tempo does run really small in size so I highly recommend going up half a size larger. Excellent design and performance. I highly recommend.": "5", "I use these Sneakers for daily training which consist of 3.2miles (5k) runs. I recommend finding the right pair of socks to wear with these sneakers or they can feel snug but they really are not. I do recommend them!!": "4", "Im a high school runner and I tend to get sore legs and minor injuries, but since the day I bought and ran with the Tempo NEXT% I feel great. The shoe really gives you a similar response to the alphaflys and provide you with the most comfort necessary to increase power in your foot strike.": "5", "I have type 2 diabetes so exercising is essential for me....but I also have neuropathy in my leggs and feet...and have had a had time finding a shoe that I can feel comfortable in while running.... and this is the only shoe that I've found that looks good and let's me workout pain free...": "5", "For me, these shoes really do lesson the perceived effort I expend in making long runs.": "5", "I run about 4 miles three to four times per week on the pavement.  The forefoot cushioning in this shoe is great, and the heel is really good.  My only gripes are that it really runs small.  I wear a 12, but there's no 12.5, so I had to stick with my regular size, but if you can, order a half size up.  Other gripe is that the upper is see-through.  Not a big deal, but a little odd.  Can't wear socks that you don't want the public to see!": "4", "These running shoes feel like you're weightless, running without effort and extremely comfortable. The were soooooo worth the money I paid for them. I have lower back problems but with these I can actually say my back doesn't bother me when I put those runny shoes on,...THANKS NIKE FOR THE EFFORT IN DESIGNING THESE SHOES...!!!": "5", "I wear this shoe to work, I do a lot of walking and this is a great work shoe.": "5", "They fit well and are very comfortable": "5", "The shoes are very comfortable.

They are light weight, have a comfortable feel, and better yet, they have a unique look. Would love to find more in my size in different colorways!!": "5", "Super comfortable, and bouncy, the only down fall is the heel tab.

They fit me true to size.": "5", "Very comfortable to run and walk": "5", "Very comfortable sneaker and design but size run little big. I highly recommend this product.": "4", "Hard to describe the sole of this shoe & how it feels.  It's very unnatural & not something i want to wear.  So much cushion in odd places.

I am very picky about what I wear. I like the cushy feeling of these shoes. Thes are more comfortable than the Adidas Boosts I have (40 pairs) and the Nike Reacts as well. These shoes are AMAZING and at the price......can't go wrong.": "5", "This shoe feels great and fits well.": "3", "I actually have two pair, this shoe is excellent for walking and being on your feet for long periods of time...

Might be best to try before buying or be prepared to exchange for a smaller size.Very comfortable, very lightweight.  You'll want to wear it all day.": "4", "I was a lil disappointed when I received the sneaker. The upper material is super thin, and I thought to myself \"where is the foot support?\" I tried them on the material felt very flimsy, but it's a good looking sneaker and the sole was very comfy and bouncy. This sneaker is suppose to be a running shoe? Not sure about that considering the upper material. But I did use them for walking and felt very comfortable. My feet were not fatigued at all. If they make the same shoe in leather I'm in!": "3", "These are raw. The wide heel looks sick, they're really light ans comfortable.

I purchased two pair and kept the ones I wore first, mainly because they are a little roomy. I like the design and how they feel when I go to the gym. These shoes got me through an indoor run, a basketball game and some. I wore some cotton socks and bada boom. I'm complaining because I'm a little short for the extra length added to the shoe!": "4", "These shoes really grew on me. Didn't like them  at first. But know they're my favorite.

He loved them. He said they are comfortable": "5", "The color looks a lot more vivid and vibrant online than in real life. They look kind of dusty or even chalky in person. It definitely was not what I was expecting. I also tried to return them and ran into issues with that as well. Its been a pretty bad hassle.": "1", "Loved the look of the Blazer 77 retro line when it dropped but this color combo made it a must have. The red and white pop with just about anything I wear it with and the throwback, almost primitive, NIKE logo (if you can call it that) on the back of the shoe is what puts it over the top. I have flat feet so these aren't daily wearers for me as they don't have as much support as other shoes I own, but definitely comfortable enough to wear out when I want the look.": "5", "I like the show although I probably should've sized up. I will also add, I am not quite sure how it works, but I never win a raffle on your site and I've rarely been able to cop exclusives at your store. I walked into one of your locations and 3 of the 5 employees somehow had on the Jordan 1 high OG Carolina blue kicks.

Shoe fit perfectly,  true to size and very comfortable. I just might have to get her another pair in another colorway. Thank you.": "5", "These are the cutest shoes and so comfortable. The tongue has foam on it to prevent them from rubbing up against your leg which is so helpful. I ordered my typical size and they fit perfectly.": "5", "True to size. Not much foot support but I love them! They're so comfy.": "5", "super good exactly as pictured! love it!": "5", "Bought as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.

Not only are they stylish but they are very comfortable. They are a little hard to get your foot in but once you adjust the laces, they are great.": "4", "Great deal and great shoes": "5", "Very comfortable and looks just like the picture": "4", "I love them a lot. But have to exchanged for a size up. They'll be used for lifting and they're just a little too tight for the gym but other than that they are greatttt": "4", "I bought these for my son and he loves them! Shopping Finish Line was so easy. The shipping  was fast and I'd definitely shop here in the future.": "5", "I was a lil skeptical at first cause Nikes tend to run narrow, and I have a slightly wide foot, and when I first put them on I was like oh no these are a lil tight, then I took the shoestrings out and loosened the shoe up a bit and tried it back on and they fit much better. Didn't realize how high they were, I know it says Mid but these fit like a high top, still got a lot of compliments on them tho. Definitely purchasing more in different color ways": "5", "I love that you can pair them with a pair of jeans or leggings, so versatile! Originally wanted the white and black but it was sold out in my size so I went for the white and red and I'm in love with the pop of color.": "5", "these shoes are a really good pickup and a underrated nike shoe at a good price at that definitely will cop another pair in the near future": "5", "Remember to order half a size up, I wear a 9 and ordered a 9.5, fit perfectly. I'll probably pair this with a white shirt dress or something similar.": "5", "I LOVE THESE. They are super cute and go with alot of stuff. They do run a little big so I recommend getting a size down.  GO GET THESE THEY ARE THE CUTEST!!": "5", "I would size up, I got a 9 but really should've gotten a 9.5, nice shoes but reminds me of converse in \"comfort\".": "3", "Got this for my girlfriend and she loved it she can style it up or down.

I think will last a long time.": "5", "these shoes are awesome they are so comfortable and can be worn with so many different styles. they are true to size but if you'd rather wear thicker socks of have more wiggle room in the toe id recommend going up a half size if possible!": "5", "Got them and they ran a little small so I switched for a half size bigger and they fit perfect!! Love these!": "5", "A very fashionable easy to style shoe. However, they are a bit narrow towards the toe section initially.

Will definitely buy more sneakers from here again!": "5", "i love these shoes! super cute and trendy. they are a little hard to get on but that goes for most high tops. runs true to size!": "4", "I was really looking forward for this shoe, but when I opened it, they shoe was dirty and used.": "3", "These shoes give me a vintage look and love styling it with my long coats. Very cozy and comfy.": "5", "I ordered these sneakers with only 4 days to Christmas and they got them to me on time with no issues with my order.  We were very satisfied and would order from them again.": "5", "It was a present and she loved it!": "5", "These shoes are my new go to! Just make sure to get them as your normal size.

The shoes also arrived from Finish Line in good timing and were a great price when I bought them.": "5", "I love these shoes so much. I purposefully sized them up bc I have kankles lol and I didnt want the shoe to be a problem. I love this color so much and they're actually fairly easy to take off and put on if you do the logical thing where you loosen up the laces :) One thing I would say is they are pretty flat and offer just above the support that a pair of Converse offers, but since I sized up I can add a sole in there.": "5", "Look great on my feet def a good pick for my style": "5", "I love the shoes just takes a bit of time to fit properly.looks great when wearing any kind of pants .": "5", "love the colorway looks really great in person the picture doesn't give it any justice.

If you're hesitant about them, this is your sign to get them NOW!!!": "5", "These shoes are super comfortable and I have gotten so many compliments on them. The material is good quality and a little stiff around the ankle at first, but no painful rubbing or discomfort. Definitely ordering another color soon!": "5", "I absolutely love my Blazers. They're definitely unisex like Nike's Air Force 1's. Definitely go up half a size because they're a little more narrow. I have wide feet, so if I ordered my usual size, it wouldn't be able to get on at all. It only takes about one day to break them in.": "5", "Could wear everyday": "5", "Fits very well and can be wore as both causal and nicer if you know how to dress it up. They aren't easy to slip on so just know you will have to un lace and re lace when you put them on. All around an amazing shoe ,and would recommend it to just about anyone.": "5", "I have three pairs of these in different colors and I couldn't be more happy. I love these and love the vintage look.

Love it.": "5", "Great clean shoe, needed a shoe that had a nice black hit to wear , this was great": "5", "Was happy to see that this Blazer was recreated perfectly; good attention to details.

I happy with the cop, and can't wait to wear them out to an event!": "5", "Look great and feel great! Color way is fire as well!": "5", "From top to bottom, this shoe is so classic! The fact that these shoes originally came out in the 70s and are still relevant today shows just how important this silhouette is to the sneaker community.This particular color-way I can style in many different ways. Light denim jeans, dark denim, and black; These shoes go with everything and that's what I like most. I can dress them up or dress them down, throw on a T-shirt with some jeans, a bomber jacket, a sweatshirt with a hat, or even a casual blazer...these shoes are a perfect addition to my collection! I also appreciate all Nike is trying to use recycled materials for the shoes and although it's an uphill battle, they are trying to help the planet. since I decided to go with white shoes, the cleaning is going to be a factor. That being said, this is an issue with any white shoe so if that's a con, then I'm OK with it. Overall, amazing job Nike!": "5", "perfect!": "5", "Great shoes for a great price": "5", "I highly recommend,": "5", "So many compliments on this shoe. And so comfortable!": "5", "These are great!

They're comfortable, they look cool. That's really all we want in life, isn't it? To look good and be comfortable? I know that's what I want. I threw these bad boys on with a nice pocket tee, Members Only jacket, and some Levi's 541s. Felt good as soon as I stepped outside.

I got these Nike Challenger OG as Finish Line had a smokin deal on them and couldn't pass up. I am a size 9.5 and they are just the right size, not to big or to small. They are a bit narrow but give it time, they will be broken in and are very comfortable to wear. I do recommend buying a pair": "5", "a good walking sneakers I have nothing bad to say about the sneakers or finish line I've purchase stuff from finish line many of time and was always satisfied  I'm from Mobile Ala the respect your employees give you makes you feel special hat's off to finish line": "5", "This was my first time to my shoes from Finish Line.

I am extremely pleased with the purchase.": "5", "I'm a HUGE sneaker fan, and as of late I've been thoroughly disappointed with the re-releases and myriad of colorways for the same silhouettes (aj-1, dunks, air max). This throwback style is refreshing to me with the mixed materials and low profile look. I will most likely be adding a few more colorways to my collection to diversify my looks.": "5", "Great shoes and fast shipping from FL. The attention to detail is lacking a bit from Nike, however. Several loose or frayed threads, tiny bits of foam threaded in random spot. Nothing small scissors can't take care of, but worth noting.": "4", "The show is a classic and it is great. It came in mint condition and fits well.": "5", "Shoes look and feel great! Fast and accurate delivery": "5", "I searched everywhere for this shoes! They look better in person, they are the perfect classic look. Although they run slightly on the small side, maybe because they are to narrow on the sides. Shipping was fast!

Could not have been a more perfect gift. He wears them all the time now.": "5", "I wear an 8.5 in mens and these run alil small. Width is perfect but size wise my toes are right at the end of shoe. But as I wear them they become alil more comfortable.": "4", "Bought them for a friend that used to wear them in high school, and just loved them. Arrived fast and in good condition.": "5", "When these shoes came they were so bright and I loved them. However when I went to wear them, they were very small.

They're just as good as I remember.": "4", "Ordered these on multiple occasions. My husband's go-to shoe. But this time the were pre-worn and scuffed up.

I got these in a 8 1/2 and after 1 day could not bear to wear them as the toe is sooo narrow and tight, it feels as if it is compressing the end of my foot. I still have room at the toe, just not on the sides. I even went as far to loosen them as much as laces would allow and still no help. If you get them, you better order a wide as the D probably will not work well for most people. I definately would never buy again..": "1", "Can't beat this deal.

Love the shoes.Only problem was I couldn't track the package.But I got the shoes anyway.": "5", "I love these shoes, they really give the \"canvas\" shoe vibes, with a softness.

With things moving to a more casual style, I wanted to find that happy medium where the casual look was there, but still professional at the same time.  These shoes take that concept to the next level.  With a throwback look that got my principle and boosters attention, to the student athletes thinking I had \"drip\".  You look good you play good.  Well as a coach, if you look good, maybe you coach good too.  These shoes are comfortable and clean up well.  They match anything and were a great choice for me to buy.  Finish line also has always been good to order from and I knew when my order had shipped and when it was on the way, no worries.": "5", "I love love it, classic shoe!": "5", "Fast shipping affordable,  arrived in good condition.

They are pretty comfortable although they aren't completely wore in yet because I've only had them 3 days. I would buy the leatger if I could do it all over again, but maybe not. I use these for leg day and my feet would burn up in leather.": "4", "I wore my shoes for easter and I looked real fly I would buy another pair just like them": "5", "The shoes are exactly wanted I wanted.

You guys have a blessed day.": "5", "If you're a fan of the look of the Nike Sacai, these are a great alternative for far, far less money. I'd recommend getting some insoles just for comfort but overall the shoe fits great and you can style these in any number of ways. Be aware, the shoes are a little narrow (I have wide feet) but the structure is pretty loose so it doesn't feel tight on my foot at all.": "5", "Do not buy the Nike Cortez knock offs": "1", "Everyday wear, very comfortable": "5", "Really like the look and feel of the shoes. They are light!": "4", "Comfortable shoe and looks good. What I hadn't noticed from the pictures is that the top part over the toes Is see through.": "5", "Great looking shoe for the price.

They also look good.": "5", "Love the shoes! Very comfortable and stylish.": "5", "Dope design I get a ton of compliments": "5", "You read that right. These shoes are trash. By that, I mean they are helping save the world little by little by literally using trash and recycled materials in the shoe itself. These shoes are extremely comfortable and have a good response in the sole when walking. The detailing and color scheme looks so much better in person too. These go great with a good pair of jeans with the gray, white and light blue color hues on the shoe. HIGHLY recommend.": "5", "Where has this shoe been my whole life? Aesthetically pleasing and extremely comfortable, the recycled materials are nice feature. Very cushion-y insoles and nice gripping texture on the sole. Definitely purchasing a backup pair for when I wear the first ones out.": "5", "Awesome, extremely comfortable": "5", "I had surgery on my ankle so the shoes I had were not comfy for me to walk in . I purchased 1 pair loved them so I went back and purchased several more of these shoes in different colors.": "5", "Bought for gift for my husband and he loves the design of the shoes and how comfortable they are.": "5", "Shoe is great and for the price during Black Friday. It was a steal!": "5", "These shoes are exactly like pictured, the style is great and they match with just about everything because of the neutral dark colors. I was surprised with how quick shipping was as well.. I was initially worried I wouldn't get these shoes on time before going on vacation, but to my surprise they actually ended up arriving even earlier than the estimated delivery date. 10/10 experience overall.": "5", "My only complaint is that it's an exact fit. I'm a 13W and this is a true 13, so I do feel a little tight in them. I haven't found a better shoe for the price. The colors are killer and the build is top-notch. I'm already looking into more 354s": "5", "The shoes match a lot of my clothes. At my job I stand all day long. Super comfortable!": "5", "They are so comfy on my feet great for running": "5", "I'm usually on my feet about 80% of my day and these keep my feet from feeling very tired.

I use them for work and I'm always on my feet. No issues so far!": "5", "great price": "5", "They are a very light shoe. That's about the only thing good about this shoe. Soles are not supportive no cushion at all. Also very narrow shoe.": "2", "Fit my feet like a sock more than a shoe. Very light, and flexible. As always with Nike, I ordered a half size bigger than I normally wear in other brands, and they fit perfect": "5", "Great look!! Very comfortable!! Fast shipping!!": "5", "Real light weight shoes nice color.": "5", "We love these type of soles, they are flexible hence the name of the shoes, these shoes are light weight and overall super comfy, my son likes them.": "5", "It's nice to walk on good pair of shoes.": "5", "Comfortable, true to size and look as pictured.

Not only do I think it's a stylish shoe but it is also a light weighted shoe. I have tried plenty of shoes for crossfit and this is byfar my favorite shoes .": "5", "It's currently serving it suppose, I first saw it on Nike's website, but was too expensive, so I decided to check further and I was lucky to find the exact product on finishline for less. Though it didn't immediately appear to what the description was on Nike's, but gradually turning into one now as I continue to step on it...overall, it's a great footwear.": "4", "Work as an Icu nurse. Always on my feet moving. Toe box is wider. Feels close to a minimalist shoe, flat. Very comfortable. Will be great for cross training shoes.": "5", "I'm a personal trainer and I have purchased other models of Nike metcon shoes and also under armour weightlifting shoes and these are by far the best shoe I have ever warn! Perfect for all kinds of training. Most comfortable for weightlifting and very comfortable to walk and run in as well. What's great is that since you adjust them with the Velcro, then if by chance your feet are swollen when you wake or sometimes when I train very heavy legs my feet swell making it very difficult and uncomfortable to wear any other type of shoe. You can still slip your foot in the shoe sock and strap it down enough to fit good and then if your swelling goes down then simply tighten up the Velcro! I love these shoes so much that I just bought my 2nd pair just to have a different color. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a very comfortable shoe": "5", "I love this sneaker very comfortable goes with any style of clothes I wear.": "5", "I was browsing through the Finishline website as usual. My son come into my office and notices I'm looking at the Nike Court Vision Low Black/White shoes. He says \"man dad those are cool\". I repplied \"they are I think I may buy them\". He said \"you should they are really nice\". So I did buy them except I bought them in his size. When those shoes came in he was surpised and super happy. He tried them on they looked really good on him and fit just right. He said \"these shoes are so comfortable and nice. Thanks dad!\" Thank you Finishline for always having quality products and great prices!": "5", "Just like white shoes": "5", "They feel very comfortable": "5", "If there were 10 different colorways (Gortex Pegasus) I'd own 10 pairs.": "5", "I love the Nike brand they make the most comfortable shoes this is My 2nd favorite shoe next to the vapormax": "5", "Just all around fire sneakers.  Some of the best I've had from Nike in years.  Super comfortable.  Grip the heel and hold in place.  Wide toe box.  Reinforced toe plate for extra durability": "5", "They are comfortable and everybody i know wants to buy them from me but i wont sell. Best sneakers i had in awhile.": "5", "Wanted a winter trail shoe that looked aggressive . I needed cushioning . The Gore-Tex was a bonus. I thought the price was high. I was not too excited when I tried the shoe on. The following day I took them out for a run and was pleasantly surprised. Have yet to try them in wet weather. Size wise I could have gone with a 1/2 size smaller. I didn't want to send the shoe back so I went a little big. I like the shoe and will continue to wear them.": "5", "I was torn between the gtx vs not gtx because I kept hearing that the gtx version wasn't breathable enough but I haven't had that problem in the least. I've worn these on 4+ hour outings with zero problems. The waterproofing works amazing and they're super comfortable after the slight break in period. Definitely recommend!": "5", "The shoe is so comfortable. You can wear it on a hike, a jog, or with some jeans. It's functional and looks really good. The materials are PREMIUM! I will probably buy them in another color also!": "5", "The product selection was a great choice. I'm mostly using for  walking. The comfort level is excellent.": "5", "This sneakers rather trail shoes are great, comfortable,and have tons of grip you seem to be able to do anything your heart desires in these great shoe": "5", "Comfortable and true to size. I had to have due to colorway.": "5", "I was happy with these shoes, I can wear them anywhere without having to worry about environmental hazards": "5", "These are just right for running around the neighborhood. I'll be running on the trails once the snow melts.": "5", "I love the feel and comfort of the shoes. I wear a size 10.5 but I should've got a size 10 as my feet aren't that wide so they fit kinda big. but overall i love the shoe I'm definitely gonna be purchasing another pair soon.": "4", "I recently bought the Nike Pegasus trail 2 I love this shoe as it's very comfortable and has a great fit I love hitting the trails with this shoe wouldn't leave home without it": "5", "The Men's Nike Pegasus Trail 2 Trail Running Shoes is an awesome shoe for every day walking and to hit the trails. I have been wearing these shoes for the past 2 weeks and it's like I'm walking on a cloud of air. The sole and cushion design are very pleasing to the feet. The only draw back is the back part of the shoe could have been raised slightly because it rubs my achilles at times.": "5", "Amazing for the gym & trail since it's initially a \"trail\" shoe, but it's performance in the gym would be amazing as well. This shoe fits comfortable and runs true to size.": "5", "I use the shoe just about every day for general wear. It's more on the right side of figment but it's very comfortable and breathable with the upper being kind of a mesh. The other area seems to be made of a rip stop type of fabric? The outsole provides great traction. The design overall is interesting.The muted colors won't show dirt as easily and the shoes are easy to clean and brush dirt off. I wish the pull tab was made out of a stronger material like leather to hold on to as it seems it's more for aesthetics. Overall a 9.5/10 shoe!": "5", "The Pegasus Trail 2, is a well constructed, responsive and very comfortable shoe, with one minor set back in my opinion. The area of the shoe that makes contact above the heel but below the achilles, doesn't seem to support securely, feeling like the shoe could slip off of your foot. The shoe runs true to size, and surprisingly not as constricting in width as most nikes can be.": "4", "Ok so right out of the box these shoes were on the money! Obviously they look great. The fit was pretty true to size, with good heel stability & a roomy toe-box. What struck me was how cush the ride is. SUPER COMFORTABLE!! Great cushioning but not so much that you don't have a feel for the surface  you're  on.. The lug  sole was very responsive & had good grip. I only did a 3.5mi run/hike but it had varying degrees of terrain and it was a great ride all the way through. If I had a con, it would be getting them on. I assume the strap in the back is to help pull them on? I don't know but I wouldn't trust it. Also, the sock-like liner at the heel was a bit tricky to straighten out. Lastly, I dunno what kind of space-age polymer Nike uses to make laces these days, but you better tie double knots because they're going to come untied. DOUBLE KNOTS... what, am I in the 3rd grade? All these are minor however. If you are a heavier runner or just like a cushioned ride, then these are the kicks for you!": "4", "Comfortable, resistant and stand up to any conditions.": "5", "These are right up there for the ultraboost for me. Very comfortable runs and plenty of bounce to keep you in the groove": "5", "These shoes are extremely comfortable while running look great. The flyknit material is thin and very breathable. I would give 5 stars but I was sent a damaged pair. The tongue on one show was ripped at the seam. Otherwise great shoes.": "4", "Got these shoes to replace a pair of Epic Reacts that I have had for a long time and absolutely love. Tried them on and the first thing I noticed was just how far in the medial side of the shoe comes into the foot. It really sticks out on the inside and it is not comfortable (unless you are someone with a very high arch). The next thing I noticed was that the React foam was a lot harder than other React shoes that I have owned. It didn't seem to have any give. I get that it is a new shoe and needs to be broken in but still, I was disappointed in that area as well. While I had the shoes on, the upper did seems pretty comfortable and secure which was nice. I just cannot get over the \"layout\" of the shoe. I was like the toe box was nice and wide, then the skinniest mid-foot, and then back to a nice wide heel area. I was disappointed with these to say the least.": "2", "Got this pair and happy with it.

As for the shoes, they're comfortable and are my second pair. I wear size 10E in dress shoes and 10.5 fit well.": "3", "Great shoes! My only complaints would be that they get worn down pretty easily. I wear these everyday at school, at home and playing pick up basketball and so the tread gets worn down quickly and the material eventually starts to rip.

We have to wear all black shoes and I noticed that people would complain after work that their feet hurt after standing for 7 hours or more.

He has had these shoes less than a month and there is a giant rip in the fabric!

They run through the size and are very light, perfect for everyday use.": "5", "I wanted light casual shoes so I bought the all white Chuck Taylor All Star II. However, I decided to trade them for the wolf grey Nike Roshe (best decision.) You could dress this down with some joggers and a tee or dress it up with a some jeans and a peacoat.

I'm a true size 11, but my in-store purchase required that I go to the next size (based the color as light blue). I ordered the black/black Roshe on-line and it was entirely too small! Had to go to a size 12 in black. Didn't understand that! Nike needs to stay true to size in all measures.

I would highly recommend them": "5", "I can wear these shoes all day I love the way they fit!": "5", "I'm on my feet all day, so these shoes are extremely comfortable. It is a little too big for me, I Ordered a 7 because there was no 6.5, but I just wear some thick socks and rock it out. Overall amazing shoes, I'm definitely getting another pair, in a fun color .": "5", "I bought these so I wouldn't have to wear black dress shoes at work.

Anyway...great shoe definitely gonna buy more.": "5", "I bought these shoes because I really liked the style and I was looking for something light but at the sametime comfortable that I can use anytime or casual Friday (work).

I bought a more limited Roshe because I like the look. But the hype of the sneaker isn't all that. Granted I got mine for a decent price knowing the rarity of the sneaker, they didn't match up to what I thought. The mesh material is a let down and the lockdown for the sneaker isn't the best. That being said, 70 dollars for a casual running shoe is a price that I can recommend to anyone.": "4", "I recommend any type of Nike Roshe products, the comfort and size satisfied me 100%. It's quality that counts not the price!": "4", "I wear a mens 13. I bought a pair of roshes true to my size.

Other than that the shoe looks amazing and is super comfortable.": "4", "I have 10 pairs of Roshes so I love the style & comfort, but beware of this Sail/Dark Ash model. I am guessing FNL got a large return batch, which is why these reappeared on the site after being gone for so long. I ordered a pair & the pair I received arrived crushed with no shoe stuffing and appeared to be worn, with scuffs on the heel & midsole & a Macy's return sticker on the box. I processed an exchange & the replacement pair was the same condition with an added dirt scuff on the heel.": "2", "These shoes are the best in my opinion.

Besides the sole being a bit on the thick end, no complaints at all.": "4", "These shoes deliver lots of comfort and style! Keep in mind these are casual shoes, so they don't have the support you would want for working out, but the thick sole and soft material of the actual shoe make them great for walking and everyday casual wear.

I wish I had went a half size down being that it has a thin, sock like material. I have wide feet. The bottom of the shoe is thick as shown. I love that I can pair these with capri Nike sweats, leggings or a dress. I will be purchasing these in more color ways.": "5", "Great sales and they have a lot more that other sneaker stores don't have. They always have plain Nike caps without the \"freak\" on it.

Highly recommend, especially at a sale price. (normal 10, run in 10.5s)": "5", "Shoes are fast and very responsive. I have had all 3 versions of the zoom fly and these are my favorite so far. They are a bit heavier than expected but nothing that is going to impede my performance. I plan to race these at California International Marathon.

Super unique and comfortable.": "5", "This is my 3rd pair and I absolutely love these sneakers. They are so comfy .": "5", "Looks amazing. I'm afraid to put it on because of how great it looks.": "5", "Such a classic shoe with a modern collab of my favorite show! Materials and quality are amazing, and the subtle details just hit perfectly.": "5", "Just as I imagined it, the color is very bright and I'm excited to wear it.": "4", "I love this shoe. Nice and simple yet modern and hip!": "2", "The color of the picture is not the same when you get the shoes.": "5", "I have flat feet and they don't pressure an arch, which is why I'm so happy with the purchase. Plus they are just so perfectly colored.": "5", "Comfortable and flashy style. Very impressed with construction and look. The red suede pops but doesn't sacrifice comfort": "3", "Great looking shoe, truly incredible design. The toes are so creased and deformed after one wear though that they're not practical.": "5", "These shoes were the perfect fit and performance without having to break them in. The leather is easily washed and they work with my casual outfits.": "5", "I think it was really cool that the collection varied in simplicity but still retained that hot ones design. The lines are seamless and quite comfortable for a daily sneak.": "2", "Wasn't crazy about it so I returned it. Normally I love the club C 85.": "5", "love it the product very comfortable and look good": "5", "Well made for the price. Had some competitors and they sucked.": "5", "Overall the quality of the shoes is great. I've had them for less than a month so I will see how they depreciate.": "5", "Perfect fit and looks great! Cant go wrong with a classic like this": "5", "These shoes are fairly similar to most Club C Shoes. I do love the collaboration with Hot Ones. Well made and feel like they will last a long time.": "5", "I was so excited to buy this shoe it's great just like all the rebel c": "5", "These shoes were stylish, very comfortable (purchased wide width) Love them.": "5", "Shoes fit true to size. I usually wear 10.5, sometimes 11. But the shoes are slightly narrow in the toe box for a wide foot. Lace adjustment was needed for more room. The weakest part of the shoe is the insole. Basic flat foam insole with little arch, heel, or ball support.": "5", "This is my first Club C sneaker and I'm happy that it's a Hot Ones collab as it's one of my current favorite shows. Love the small details in the shoe and it's not too flashy. I can rock this shoe with my street wear outfits and look nice.": "5", "Looks good and fits as expected. Well made.   Would recommend": "5", "Size was too big but the easy exchange process was amazing and so easy / fast": "5", "Overall a great shoe! Love the design and all of the thought that went into this collaboration! My first pair of Reebok's and I was worried about the sizing but they fit great and are comfortable!": "5", "Droopy made classic Reebok style  even better   It feels a bit small for me so try your size and half size bigger to decide which one fits best.": "5", "Killer shoes, super comfy, awesome look too. What an awesome shoe.": "5", "Fantastic shoe. I was happy to see this collab and glad I own a pair. Size was perfect and it was very comfortable.": "4", "Shoe is great, however it seems like they were broken into but it could be just the material. Overall... Satisfied": "5", "Stylish and durable. I love the soft leather. The more wear on the shoe the better it will get. This is my third pair!": "5", "One of my favorite shoes  collaborating with an equally awesome YouTube series is my dream come true. I love how simple, yet stylish these shoes are, and the color compliments almost everything I wear. Size runs true to size and the shoes themselves feel comfortable and light.Love!": "5", "They are all around nice shoes. They look just as good today as they did when I was a kid, I would recommend these classics to anyone with or without classic style.": "5", "Absolutely love Reebok products. The shoes are very comfortable but seem to run a bit small and narrow for my white foot however still quite comfortable.": "5", "Would buy it again, wish it had less white. But this is a classic": "5", "Amazing shoes, super cute, very comfortable and fit perfectly": "4", "Very soft shoes love them. I wear them for work they very comfortable": "5", "They're simple, clean, comfortable and basic. The fit is good but typical Reebok's they do come a tad big. I wear 10.5 in every brand but I'm probably a true size 10 in Reebok.": "4", "Great quality, comfortable, runs slightly big size down": "5", "They look great and feel great. I've worn them a few times and always get compliments.": "4", "I have really enjoyed them after wearing them for about two weeks now. Great quality, handle wear very well and keep clean. Minimal design with the nice accents make these a killer in the black with gum/natural soles. Perfect color combo for pretty much anything I wear. Really liked these and will get another pair at some point.Only gripe; they are definitely narrow. Once I grab a few more pairs of kicks I will really enjoy these more. As a pair of shoes you plan on wearing for a while, you may find some discomfort after a few hours of wearing them.": "5", "Love this collab. Shoes are of excellent quality as always. The box is what did it for me, big fan of all collars but this one is one of my favorites.": "5", "It is very well made, the sizing was a bit too small": "5", "Honestly can't speak enough on these. Another slept on classic collab. All the little details elevate the shoe above the average collab. Nothing is overstated, and on first look one might not even recognize them as a Tom and Jerry shoe. However, upon closer inspection it becomes clear. From the cheese color to the slight pink hints, the embroidered patches to the Jerry face on the tough tag. Over all a perfect custom!": "5", "I bought this pair of Club C 85 with the Zig Kinetica Pride shoes together and love both of them. The Zig Kinetica Pride is no longer available so I'm just writing the reviews here. First of all, they both fit just about perfect and true to size.  Obviously, they look great and my biggest dilemma is which pair to wear most of the time. The colors are vibrant just like the pictures here.   I wear the Club C for day to day walking and the Zig Kinetica at work (I'm an ER nurse so really rough on shoes).  They are both comfortable though I personally prefer the Zig Kinetica over the Club C.  Top of the Club C feels a little tight so I typically try not to tie it too tight and then it's ok.  The Zig Kinetica is super comfortable and it's almost like walking on clouds.  I've got lots of compliments with both pairs and would love to buy more in the future.": "5", "the colors were so much brighter than expected!! Comfortable fit": "4", "I bought a men's size 5.5 to match my women's size 7.5 and it was a little snug": "5", "What can I say, these are classic. Looks great, feels great.": "5", "I swear by these shoes. Reebok classics are always in style and fit those with wider feet much better than other big athletic brands.": "5", "I guess it's better than china tho lol. Quality was ok but I figured for the price, they'd be a lil more authentic.": "5", "The overall quality is great and they are comfortable.": "5", "These are cool to wear, beat em up or keep em fresh.": "5", "These are amazing, like most all Club C's. I was very happy when unboxing to feel the quality of materials and the softness to the shoe. Quality red color as well.": "5", "They old school,  I love it!! reminds me a especial presente from my father": "5", "Good deal  nice orange colorWill recommend these shoes": "5", "These shoes are so stylish and comfortable. I these shoes!": "5", "I would buy this shoe in different colors for the price I brought them for": "5", "These shoes are very comfortable. I have problems w. comfort, as I work a lot, so I'm constantly standing. These shoes take on that challenge  gracefully.": "5", "Looks good, feels good. Got W7.5. Adds some masculine taste.": "5", "I love the club c. Classic look and comfort. I normally wait for the higher quality material drops but this colorway was a must cop. I am completely pleased with this purchase": "5", "These are comfortable and the stacked look is great": "5", "A bold yet subtle take on a timeless classic. The first all red shoe i've owned that can add flashiness or just a hint of color. The use of suede and all red midsole allows these C 85s the option for daily or occasional wear. Well Done!": "5", "Color scheme, style, design and level of comfort makes this my favorite style of Reebok. They treat customers very well here": "5", "As expected from a good Reebok classic: Top quality & great comfort!": "5", "I wear these every day now. So comfy and easy to style.": "5", "I have this style in several colors! I always get complements on them.": "5", "Very happy with this purchase. Comfortable and stylish.": "5", "I bought this pair of sneakers for my brother. Very comfortable, perfect fit and stylish. He loved it.": "4", "-Purchased in Vector Navy / Utility Green / Alabaster which gives retro looks, team up with worn out selvedge denim for that 80s feel-Outsole is off-white rather than bright white which goes very well with the overall shade-Although categorized as \"Tennis inspired\" design, don't buy for playing as the shoes are not that comfortable (may use a more padded insole), good enough for casual outings-Runs a bit large, buy half or one size down": "5", "I have a thing for white trainers, especially club c 85 and own about 5 pair but these are my new favorites. Great quality, great for and they look better in real life than on the photos.": "5", "I bought these for my brother and he wears them all the time. I have a couple other pairs of reebok sneakers and they are my favorite shoes.": "5", "I got these for my daughter who recently came out and she absolutely loves them! What a great way to show your support and look super cute! They fit to size and are very comfortable. Great buy!": "5", "These shoes make a statement. So super stylish on my son's feet! Love!": "5", "They were slightly larger than normal but they're still good to walk in. I like them a lot": "5", "Look great with almost everything even a skirt! They are comfortable and are easy t to wear all day long.": "5", "Nice design. Reminds me of going to the shoe store with my gramps.": "5", "I can't complain I love Reebok's! They are just the shoe that reflects who I am thanks!": "5", "Love my shoes even hubby wanted a pair. Comfortable for shopping for more.": "4", "I like my sneakers.  The thing that bothers me with alot of my sneakers from reebox is on the left side of my foot it hurts": "5", "Is it reflective material and looks great in low light, cool fade to black type of look": "2", "Too narrow across the toes, uncomfortable side heel.  I could feel the outside heel seam.": "5", "i tend to buy cute but uncomfortable shoes and i impulse bought these and they are now the most comfortable shoes i own. great for 7 hour shifts standing and in my experience they work great for skating and have a good amount of grip.": "5", "These are so cute and comfortable < 3 they look way cuter in person": "5", "Absolutely love these!!! Received them and they completely surpassed my expectations! Great quality well put together. Only downside would be they are a little smaller that true size. Other than that love them!": "5", "These shoes are amazing and very throwback. I get a lot of compliments on the style! My only complaint is the outsole is a little brighter than the picture. The anti smudge outsole  actually works I don't have any smudge after 3 months of daily use.": "5", "Solid multi-seasonal shoe.  I was remarkably surprised by how much support they have.  Probably going to get a second pair in a different color.": "5", "I love these shoes, they're extremely comfortable and extremely stylish! Would purchase again!": "5", "Great looking and fitting shoe!  A true classic. you will be quite pleased to add this shoe to your collection.": "5", "The shoes run a tad bit too small. Overall comfort is great. Very well made shoe with adequate stitching.": "5", "This is my 3rd pair of Club C 85 shoes and they did not disappoint. I liked the colorway and the comfort as they were on point. Glad to add it to the collection.": "5", "I need a firm long wearing sole and this style fits my needsGreat look also": "5", "I really like these shoes they go with most outfits and are really cute and simple": "5", "It feels like I'm walking on clouds. That's how comfortable they are.  Nothing else really remarkable to say. They look like I expected based on what I saw online and they fit well in my usual size.": "4", "Shoe is well made and comfortable. Simple design, vulcanized outsole and is very grippy depending on surface. If you're not flat footed and the insole is not a good fit for you, you can always get a pair of insoles specific to your feet. Have had other similar shoe type from different brands but Reebok did pretty well with this one. The only discrepancy I can point out so far are the laces (black). Stitches/threads are coming out and are easily pulled after only 2 weeks of use, so I might have to upgrade that to a better quality. Other than that, it's a solid pair of shoe.": "5", "Great shoe, fair price. Very versatile, style-wise, and a staple to any closet.": "5", "These are my second pair of Club C'sThey get more comfy and better looking as time goes on": "5", "You might want to change the soles, they are not for long walks or walks at all": "5", "ANother Club C homerun.

I bought the shoe based on their size chart and had to exchange for another shoe a full size bigger.Otherwise I love the shoe. The leather upper is super soft and flexible.

I love the color and it fits well.": "4", "These shoes are very comfortable and cute!  Great quality and looks even better on.": "4", "Shipping was super fast only a couple days. Love the shoes. Only thing is that the material above the toe is not great quality. I think it might peel. But the rest of the shoe is great quality. Would recommend.": "5", "Classic. Versatile. Can dress em up or down. They match everything.": "5", "Live the classic look with updated colorways, definitely a vibe": "4", "very comfy (if just slightly small). the actual color is a brighter white than shows on the site just fyi.": "5", "I purchased these shoes on a whim. Are usually wear all white I figured I'd change it up a little bit and they're great. You never know that people are looking at your shoes until you get compliments on a new pair.This is let me explore more colors and even some wacky designs. Same comfort as the white ones I wear. Love them.": "5", "The colors really stand out, I love the style of these sneakers.": "5", "I love the color combo, and they're extremely comfortable.

The colorway and various leathers used on this particular pair are top notch.": "2", "Slightly roomier than I like, but then again I'm slightly between sizes": "5", "Very comfortable and stylish! Not to mention, I got it at a good price!": "5", "I live the color, the style and it is what I was expecting from the beginning": "5", "They are very flat and they don't have a lot of support, but I have very big feet and it's hard to find shoes in my size so I like that.": "3", "Well made but too narrow. No wider option available": "5", "I love the classic look and wearability with anything. I haven't had a pair since high school, so I was very excited to get another at such a good price. They're a tad narrow, but my right foot is slightly wider than my left so that's no mark against the shoes.": "4", "Everything is just perfect from size to color to fitting": "5", "I normally wear a women's size 8 and a 7.5 in Adidas shoes.

First off the look amazing off the bat and soft and plush but cant say how long they will last. Time will tell. Very comfortable and stylish. I ordered these in a mens 9.5 and it is a perfectly fit.

Very comfortable and looks really good.": "4", "Was a little worried about ordering shoes online especially with these colors. Shoes arrived before expected delivery date and relatively quick.The look and fit at first took some getting used to but fit to form now.

I really like the colors and love the message.  I'm not the biggest fan with how they look on, however.  It could be because I'm more used to the trainer look.

I ordered a size 9 which is what I usually wear & it feels like an 8 1/2. My advice would be to order a half size or 1 full size bigger than what you normally wear because the shoe may feel fine at first, but after you've been walking around for a couple hours you definitely feel the discomfort around the toes.

If you have wide feet I don't recommend this shoe.": "4", "I've been wearing this exact shoe style for 20+ years and I've never found a more comfortable \"dress\" shoe.": "5", "Perfect for summer!

They are so sleek and stylish for a 17 year old like myself, and the quality to budget ratio may be the best out there.

Super comfortable, flexible, and is easy to pair with outfits.": "5", "Shipped the wrong size. Returning today. Overall nice shoe in person.": "3", "I bought this pair for my boyfriend. He expected the mid-sole area to look more smooth, but it was a heavy dotted rubber texture. I believe the texture also made coloring of r sole look different than that of the shoe.": "3", "These are SO comfortable.  This is my 3rd or 4th pair over the last 5 or 6 years.  I've never worn them out, just replace them because I like the smell and feel of new ones.": "5", "The style is simple yet unique and the size (6) was on spot. Personally I wouldn't recommend for long walks, it's more of a stylish look than every day use. The dark color sole was what sold me due to the shoe being overall white but with a dark color it gives it accent, especially since it would look overall dirty if the bottom was a light color.": "5", "Love them. Trendy and comfortable. Will purchase again.": "5", "I LOVE THESE SHOES, they are so amazing and so cute. they match with everything!": "5", "These shoes are made very poorly.After 3 hours and 1/8 of a mile walking, the leather is starting to tear.

Great for skateboarding or just walking the block.": "5", "I have worn a 500 pairs of sneakers in my day and this ranks near the top! Work or play they are appropriate! Great value and great quality!": "5", "Shoes look great and seem to be well made. I got them to replace my Nike AF1s that were falling apart after only a few months of use. The shoes are narrow and run smaller (comparing to AF1s in the same size), however, I am a female  and these are advertised as men's shoes so that may have something to do with it?  Also noticed they are much lower cut on the ankle than AF1s, and although this does not bother me personally, it may be helpful for other people to know!": "5", "It was just okay for me. Not comfy. Quite disappointed on my first order.": "3", "Great retro shoe - however, it feels different than the ones I originally purchased in the mid-70's,  they had more cushion or padding than these in the sole.

This is my go-to casual sneaker.": "5", "I thought these were really cute I just needed a half size smaller": "5", "I love the style and look of the sneakers. But they were a little uncomfortable.

You can style with them with anything": "5", "Was looking for a white sneaker and had the choice between club Cs and air forces. Think i made the right choice.": "4", "Really cool sneakers: comfortable and well made. On the small side, though.": "5", "I have purchases Reebok shoes  both in stores and on line.  They are a comfortable walking shoe.  When I buy them on line I know they'll fit because of the good quality control.  the size doesn't  vary from batch to batch.

They also look great and are easy to wear with many casual outfits.": "5", "The quality is a bit lower, on the inside some of the stitching looks like it may not last too long. But besides that, and I think they will last plenty long, they are great shows": "5", "These shoes are a best buy bargain.  They are great looking, comfortable and of excellent quality.I am 100% satisfied with the purchase.": "5", "The comfort this shoe has makes it worth it all on its own, but then you add the style and it brings it to a whole new level. 10/10": "5", "You call them vintage, but somethings don't go out of style.  Great quality, comfortable and just plain white, no green neon or blinking heels just plain white, getting hard to find.": "5", "These are great classic shoes that fit orthotics And are always consistent": "5", "A very stylish look, the vintage look of the shoe is very appealing.": "5", "These sneakers have that classic look and feel, and look great with every fit.

I've had mine going on a year now and they've held up almost like new after beating them up relentlessly. So comfortable and well constructed, these are a steal for the price. Super easy to clean and they age very well unlike a lot of other leather sneakers. I've gone through a number of other brands/silhouettes, and none compare to the Clubs. Don't even think twice, just cop these and put them on straight out of the box. Low key phenomenal skate shoes too.": "5", "Pretty cool kicks": "5", "I would recommend this shoe to anyone going for a fun, stylish, and vintage looking type of style to add to their wardrobe. The shoe is comfortable, spacious, and cushioned to where you feel like your slipping your feet into a house slipper. But it still maintains the elegance and sportiness you'd expect with a classic Reebok shoe like this. It creases something fierce after first wear and seems like it might fall apart on me within the first year but it's a great shoe while it lasts.": "5", "So comfortable. Don't even feel like they need to be broken in.": "5", "I purchased these iconic, multi-season sneakers to chum around in. I remembered seeing these when I was younger. They are very comfortable and the off-white sole camouflages dirt well, but cleans very easily. They easily match up with jeans, chinos, or shorts. The laces are a bit long in my opinion so I may or may not switch those out.": "5", "Very pleased with the purchase. Would purchase these shoes again.": "5", "The leather is on par with shoes that cost twice as much!!": "5", "best shoe u can get. it's literally perfect omg. it's fashionable AND comfortable. what more do u want\u2049\ufe0f": "5", "The tan color really does looks nice, the inside of the shoe feels amazing there's so much cushion. It feels like I'm walking on pillows. Definitely recommend.": "5", "Took a chance on these. Never owned Reebok's before. Thought these looked awesome on an ad and they look even better in person. The silhouette is the perfect old school look. The materials and leather are softer than what you typically get on new shoes and it allows for nice creases in the toe that add to the vintage look of the shoe. Also love the material inside the shoe which old school and is prone to getting lots of sock fuzz. Just really gives them the old school shoe vibe which is what you buy these for. My only request is that Reebok offer a wide width but of course they won't. 10/10 buy then now": "5", "The comfort and style in this shoe go hand in hand together! I have wider than normal feet so many other shoes that I have purchased in the past have mostly been a super tight fit width-wise even in half a size up but the Club C 85's fits comfortably and snug on my feet. I would definitely recommend this shoe for any of your casual needs and it can be incorporated into nearly any outfit.": "5", "I like the shoes. My only comment would be about the leather.. it looks like faux leather.. In the future you should stick with real leather! It's more durable.": "4", "These are my favorite pair right now. They are stylish and simple. I can  pair them with anything really.": "5", "Love everything about it except staring down makes me not like the width.": "4", "They are slightly narrow so I'd recommend going up 1/2 a size, but overall these shoes are quite comfortable.": "5", "I wear an eleven in Nikes.  Ordered these in an eleven as well and a bit too small.  I think an 11.5 would have been perfect.": "5", "I've been wearing these for a little over a week, and I can honestly say that these are the best shoes I've ever owned. They're comfortable, classic, and immediately upgrade any look that I'd usually wear with Converse. Can't recommend highly enough.": "5", "Really nice goes with anything  easy to style with any type of clothing": "5", "Love the shoes they are true to fit and look amazing! I want to get these in all the colors! Shout out to Finish Line and Reebok!": "5", "Very stylish shoe. It's my everyday shoe. I like it": "5", "I've been wanting these for a little while now and finally decided to buy them.Pricing is a bit more than I like paying for shoes, but they are good quality!Very comfortable and a nice vintage look.Pleased with my purchase.": "5", "Great shoe, looks even better on feet. My package arrived sooner than expected as well!": "5", "Well-constructed and timeless design. I love cream colored tennis sneakers and this fills the hole perfectly": "4", "Amazing purchase. The shoe is very comfortable. GO WITH YOUR TRUE SIZE! The leather on these shoes are great. They crease very nicely. :)": "5", "These are great shoes. I bought as a present and they were a big hit!": "5", "Good looking classic shoe. Classic but also timely.": "5", "The feet feel the beat but never the heat when I'm walkin the street in my new tasty bois! I'm shwasty but never hasty when I'm wearing my new kicks.": "5", "Bought this style years ago.

Cute and comfy  stylish and sun lives them tue to size": "5", "My son loved his gift! Put them on as soon as he opened his present.": "5", "I'd rate it a 5 star but the insides seemed a little worn out. The reebok logo on the sole was already fading. But besides that the rest of the shoe is high quality and very comfortable to wear.": "4", "Very comfortable and good quality leather. Look even better than I thought and can't go wrong with a classic look": "5", "I bought the c85 in black leather with white sole and loved them. After some debate, took a risk on chalk white leather and love them even more. And I get so many compliments. Old school style and soooo comfy. Highly recommend.": "5", "So comfy and versatile color goes with everything ..........": "5", "The shoes were very comfortable and esay fitting for me.": "5", "come on reebok make  these  classics  in wide 4E  like  you  have  in  the  past": "4", "Great materials and construction. Sleek yet detailed design. Fits like a glove but I am expecting it to loosen up over time and mold to my feet. I would recommend going either tts or a half size up": "5", "Great quality and comfort.  On point with size and will age great.": "5", "I enjoy these a lot. Defiantly gonna be purchasing more shoes like this.

Comfortable": "5", "The shoe looks great, is comfortable, and is great quality.": "5", "Very comfortable and I have worn these exact shoes for 30 years and love them.  One small item wish they came in a slightly wider width but over all they are A-1.  Keep making them.": "5", "A weird review here but I had to mention it. I am a size 11 in Nike Women, when seeing reviews for this shoe people complained it was too narrow and the size chart for women felt off so I went ahead and got the men's shoe in a size 10.5 and it was perfect. I should say its very comfortable and feels well built and fits my wide feet well. The shoe started creasing ASAP which was weird because the normal white ones don't crease as fast as these do but I'm keeping these. They pair well with a lot of outfits. I don't know why I never found these shoes before or else I'd have snagged them a long time back. I'm recommending this shoe to all my friends.": "5", "If you are in between two sizes, size down. I turned these into beaters because they are comfortable and pair well with almost everything.": "5", "I love to wear these everyday cause of how comfortable they are.": "5", "Fast shipping and very good quality product! Would buy it again for sure": "5", "Solid shoe. Comfortable and looks to be decent quality.": "5", "I love this pair of shoes.

I could wear them all day and not notice- Happy with my purchase :)": "5", "Reebok, don't ever stop making the C85's, and give us more color options. These have easily become my favorite pair of shoes and will be buying many more pairs over the years.": "5", "Overall great with every fit. It works with any style": "5", "Absolutely loved these shoes, first time I bought the off-white classic style. Have purchased Reebok's for the past few years and will continue to do so, always a comfortable, affordable, and classic shoe.": "5", "This shoe fits very well, although my foot is slightly wide for it.

They go with so many fits.  Love it!": "5", "They are great shoes, but don't trust the sizing guide on the website.

Like years before. I love them, they go with everything.  TTS and if you're in between sizes, size down.": "5", "I'll be honest. When I first walked around in them, I felt a slight discomfort on the inside of the right sneaker and it showed when I took the sneakers off after coming home. For the first few days, there was a slightly visible red bump where my big toe sits. After weeks of wearing the shoes though, this loosens up. I also really love the comfortable insole. Comes in handy as I am always on my feet all day.": "5", "It was for my best friend's birthday. reebok was always his dream shoes brand. On site there is written that 9.5 is for 44 size (europe) but when I got the order on the box there was written size 42.5 and it turned too small :(  I wish I had a chance to replace them": "1", "These are exactly what I wanted. I'll be ordering more.": "5", "Id recommend  them as they are comfortable to wear and they look cool with many outfits": "5", "I would only recommend it to women or men with no arch in their foot.

Why do you not make this shoe in wider sizes????": "1", "Beautiful color, nice cheap beater. Leather is good quality.": "4", "the shoes are very nice. easy to style. good for skating": "4", "very comfortable and fits snug but there is visible insulation on the walls of the shoe next to the tongue which, in my opinion, adds an unwanted yellow color toward the whole aesthetic of the shoe but that is a very minimal nit picky complaint. Overall a very solid shoe.": "4", "They look amazing in person. I received many compliments the first time I wore them.": "5", "It is wide enough to allow me to insert an orthotic brace I have to wear and feels great on my feet.": "5", "I love the clubs and always wanted a pair because I saw my friends wearing them. I love my shoes they are just what I wanted.": "5", "Totally what I like. However, my only problem was the outside decking of the shoe isn't a true white and the shoe is a true white.": "4", "Gum soles are fly. Much better than basic version.": "5", "They are true size. The style looks like the ones you had back in the time.": "5", "Shoes are soft and comfortable.

I took out the insole which I do with all my sneakers & replaced it with an orthotic sole.": "5", "The shoe was nice except that it had quite a few defects.

I have no idea when or why they resized them, but  10.5/D from 1985-2010 is certainly no more than a 10/B in 2020. If they felt the need to narrow the shoe by 1/2inch or more, then they need to make W/2E or X-Wide/4E actually available. I did have to buy a 10.5/4E a few years ago to get the same size as my previous pair of std C85, but figured with the Vintage they'd have used the original template. No more Reeboks without trying them on in-store. Buying/Shipping/Returning over and over or buying 4 pair and returning 3 is just too wasteful": "3", "I like it because if the design of different compared to other shoes": "4", "Great looking, a bit stiffI'm a trainerI max out at 4 hours in these": "5", "It looks wonderful.

Would highly recommend.": "5", "Love the vintage off white look, great with jeans or shorts.": "5", "I love this shoe it's very comfortable. I can also wear this shoe casually if I choose. Great shoe!": "5", "Good quality and very comfortable can be standing all day and feet do not hurt": "5", "I'm always hesitant to order shoes online without trying them on first, but these fit true to size and are very comfortable.

I haven't owned a pair of reeboks in a while.": "4", "I love the fit of the sneaker as well as the silhouette. It's something I can wear casually or even dress up a little. The color is perfect.": "5", "These shoes were everything that I expected them to be!": "5", "Has the feel and look of the Classic shoe I have loved for many years.": "5", "I like the retro style and the craftsmanship behind the shoe.": "4", "I love the style and feel of the classics, sizing was spot on, but the shoe is already coming apart near the front where it seems it wasn't glued properly.": "3", "They're very heavy and not really for all-day wear.

It has everything you need .": "5", "Hey it's a Reebok and we expect quality. The inner padding seems harder to me as I've expected a softer cushioned feel in the shoes as in the past.

I wanted to like these shoes because they were a pair I had always wanted as a kid, but couldn't afford. I love the color way and the nostalgia is the only reason I'm rating this high. These are very average-to-below-average in every way. They are not comfortable at all. The Hexalite isn't really Hexalite, just decorative. The midsole foam is hard and cheap.

It is  def hard but isn't uncomfortable.First the looks. They are HOT.  Pun intended. Guessing these will get plenty of attention.The insole is memory foam which I'm not a big fan of. Not sure how that will be in long term wear but initially not bad. The sole is hard and the only way I can describe it is you know how nurses always wear clogs and they all say they're really comfortable? That's the best way I can describe them.The hexalite in the heal is a joke and is just for show. I wonder why they don't use the floatride on these like they do on the Zig Kinetica.They def fit true to size as I wear 9.5 and they have plenty of room in the toe box.Gotta say, I really like them so far. Upset I didn't get the instapump OG with boost from last year but I def will be purchasing more styles in the future.": "5", "I got my lady these and he loves them.

These shoes are particularly great for women who need more width in the toe box.": "5", "The laces are very wide set and  a little short because of this, very over padded shoe, not uncomfortable but you have to tie them a little tight to have enough lace.

These are a game changer for me and I wish I had found them sooner. Lightweight shoes that even at the end of a long feel feels like I'm walking on clouds. Also, it's hard to make size 13's look stylish but you managed to pull that off too. Hats off.": "5", "Good shoe overall. Runs a tad larger than most shoes I've tried. It's an active shoe...

They are immediately comfortable, minimal break in period, and a perfect balance of warm and water proof for Wisconsin winters.": "5", "Despite all the hype and all the rave about these, these boots surpassed all expectations. First time Timberland buyer and I absolutely will be purchasing MORE! Wore them on a rainy day and the waterproof is 100% !.": "5", "The color stands out and it's comfortable": "5", "Great pair of boots! Definitely order a size smaller than your regular shoe size. I'd recommend going to a store and trying them out to see if you need Wide ones. Love them so far and will get them in other colors!": "5", "These go good with shorts, sweats, jeans or anything really.I got these as a gift for Jogging along with a jogging hammer.For daily use leave the laces loose but if you need to liberate a TV or some Nike's, lace them up tight for maximum performance and grip.": "5", "I like them alot.": "5", "This was a last minute order. My boyfriend was getting frustrated that he couldn't find any in stores. So I told him to check online. Ladies we all know how some men can be when it comes to actually looking for stuff. I let 2 weeks past before I decide to order them for him. The look on his face when I asked him to open the door and the FEDEX gave him the box. He stated what you done ordered now and I told him me some shoes. Well fast-forward later on that night while he was laying in the bed I came out the shower with the boots on. Even though they 3 sizes to big the look on his face at the boots was PRICELESS. He was jumping on the bed like a kid. In all it was well worth it though.\ud83d\ude05": "5", "This pair didn't fit as comfortably as my others. The fit is just a little too big. They fit as though they're size 11.25, so getting another size wouldn't work. My boots are 11 M/M. The color is nice.": "3", "I have been wearing the boots daily, to work and play. After initial break-in period of 2 days they are extremely comfortable. I did purchase the replacement insoles because they are far superior to the ones included. The insoles are from Timberland too and improve being able to stand and walk in the boots all day long. I walk a good amount and need reliable footwear and these exceed that requirement. No doubt these will last me a long, long time. I usually go with hiking boots but decided for the traditional look of some Tim's. Could not be happier with my purchase!": "5", "Just used for every day life. Comfortable and durable": "5", "Solid boot but too big. Will re-purchase in correct size": "4", "BEST BOOT EVER": "5", "My boyfriend loved these!! They fit perfect and looked great!": "5", "I love it!..feels perfect!..love the 6 1/2 size!...will definitely be coming back!..": "5", "My son loved them!": "5", "I have been needing a new pair of boots for some time and decided on these. The interior seems smooth and they seem comfortable so far. The laces look good but are hard to tie and cinch, perhaps some thicker ones would work better.": "4", "Purchased these for my husband and he loved them!": "5", "I love the look of the saddle leather. It's a little tight on top of my feet, but not overly so. With a little walking, these will break in.": "5", "The color combo is what attracted me.": "5", "These boots are beautiful and very stylish.They look great with jeans and a leather jacket on a cool afternoon!": "5", "Fashion , they look great . Live the water proof material": "5", "I usually wear my boots on days we have bad weather like if it's raining or snowing. It keeps my feet warm and dry from bad weather. It's a comfortable fit on my feet and wouldn't want any other brand than timberland boots on my feet.": "5", "These are the best boots ever. I really thought they wouldn't last through anything but they've been through rain, snow, mud, you name it. I needed another paid badly": "5", "These boots are comfortable, warm and great in the snow.These boots are a New York City Icon.": "5", "I bought the 6\" premium Rust Nubucks for my boyfriend and he loves them. I ordered a full size down (9.5 instead of his normal 10.5) and they fit great. Now I'm ordering a new pair of work boots for me!": "5", "My only problem with timberland itself is the price of the boot is a little on the steep side especially growing up wearing the boots since the nineties nothing is changed but the price and I think everything should stay original. But I also get its a business guy to make money but there never gonna not be body": "5", "Casual wear during cold weather months..": "5", "I wold boy this product again and again": "5", "I normally wear a US size 11 in shoes (occasionally 10.5 depending on the shoe). I bought the 6 inch Premium Timberland Boots in store and I tried on both a size 11 and a size 10.5 When I put on my normal size (11), it felt completely comfortable but when I walked I could tell it was too loose. I tried on the 10.5 and it felt better. It was still comfortable but it felt like I could walk better in it without it feeling like it would fall off my feet.I've now had mine for 5 months. I think the 10.5 is good enough for me, but if I recommend one thing to all potential buyers, it's: go down a full size, or at least a half size. Many people like to wear their Timbs loose and not tied tightly. With my 10.5, I have to actually tie the shoes (loopty-loop then pull and all) in order for the boots to feel snug to my feet. Although walking in them without the shoes tied does not have a significant risk of the boots falling off your feet, it still feels very loose.So in the future, I will purchase a full size down in Timberlands (meaning I will buy a size 10 in Timbs). If no full size down is available, then I'll go for a half size down since it is still satisfactory. I do not recommend buying your normal shoe size as it will feel comfortable when standing/sitting still, but when you walk, the boot will be very loose.I also recommend spraying your boots with Timberland's balm protector & water proofer to help extend the life of your boots to protect them from snow and water. If any salt gets on your boots, make sure you clean them so the salt doesn't sit in the boot for too long and end up damaging the material.----------------------TL;DR: Go for a full size down from your normal shoe size. If a full size down is not available, then go at least for a half size down. I wear a US size 11 in sneakers, and I bought a 10.5 in Timbs; however, a 10 in Timbs would likely be even better. Additionally, take care of your boots by cleaning them and spraying them with waterproofer.": "4", "Great boots always a fan of theses. Will purchase another pair soon.": "5", "Walking around rainy city": "5", "I was walking in the rain with my timbs on stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm": "5", "Waterproof is great for snow": "4", "I wear these whenever I want to feel extra fly.

They make me look so stylish. These are definitely better and more heavy than the Newmarket's (which was my first pair) and I decided to check out the premiums, and they're even better! Love it!": "5", "Buying two pairs!": "5", "My wife bought me these boots for work and I've never been more comfortable in work shoes before. Definitely waterproof and sturdy for the work I do. Extremely comfortable and look awesome.": "5", "Nice one": "3", "Great quality, as expected! Besides delays in receiving my order, everything was great!": "5", "My Husband loves these boots!!": "5", "This boot has to be yet the classiest looking color combination they've ever released.  Just remember in the 6\" boot to order a full size smaller. I wear a 12 in every other Timberland and all my Under Armour shoes and boots. But this style I wear an 11. I have 12 different colors in these boots and learned it from the first purchase they were Big!!!": "5", "The quality and texture of all the materials worth the price. These were a staple in high school and buying my first pair years later feels the same. Proud of my purchase!": "5", "Can't go wrong if your wearing this in the winter or any time of year.": "5", "This boot is amazing and feels great. The boot because of the quality can be purchased a half size smaller than actual foot size. If you wear a 10 1/2 you can get a 10.": "5", "Great gift. The quality you expect. Classic timberland style. It's worth it.": "5", "The quality felt super nice but the boots were about half a size too big. Return process is incredibly user friendly so I'm returning these and will immediately purchase a smaller size. Looking forward to it!": "4", "I USE THE PRODUCT FOR STYLING.

Well worth money spent.": "5", "My boyfriend loves the new color! Fit great": "5", "Timberland is one the top best boots out!": "5", "My boyfriend loves his Tims.": "5", "The fit / finish of Timberland products is first rate and I didn't realize I could buy directly from Timberland until this purchase. I was seeing internet horror stories of bogus Timberlands and customers receiving used/returned boots, presumably as new, so the buying experience directly from Timberland was excellent as well.": "5", "These keep your feet warm. I did have to return my 6.5 for a 7. I read the reviews before I brought them and they run true to size.": "4", "Buy your Tim's 1/2 a size lower and you get a perfect fit": "5", "My son loves his new boots": "5", "Casual wear and work": "5", "I bought these for my husband and he loved them. The color is fabulous. I hate that they don't come in women's sizes.": "5", "Use for everything- Timberlands are classics! We call the wheat boots \"Butters\"! Never gets old or out of style!": "5", "The boot looks nice however its a bit too big. I wear Nike size 9.5 and ordered a half size down. Turns out still too big.": "4", "I bought the \"Rust Nubuck\" as a gift for my friend. The color looked more like the \"Medium Brown\" than an orangish-brown that was shown in the picture. The pictures probably used some sort of warmth filter to make the boots look more appealing. Still good quality and my friend loved it, but I am still slightly disappointed in the color difference.PS: The three-day shipping took 6 days to arrive, but my review only reflects on the product itself. If I were to consider the fact that the gift arrived three days past the estimated delivery (supposed to arrive ON Valentine's Day), the overall shopping experience with this product would be more of a 2-star.": "3", "Great boots, go down a full size": "4", "I am a 10.5 in all my other shoes, but I ordered a 10.

Perfect boots.": "5", "Great boots": "5", "So my normal size shoe is a 15 but I can buy that I'm Timbs because their too big so I get a 14. Not much of a good selection if you wear a 14 in boots with Timbs. If it was I would try other boots. The boot fits me great nice width def not too narrow. Great color I have the Rust Nubuck that looks great with black green and a very light blue Jean. Doesn't provide much warmth so west a good pair of thick socks. It's for sure hard to put on due to their being no added grip or pull tag to the collar. Their definitely not built for long walks so be mindful of that as well. To give you an example of my physique I'm 6\"3 415 pounds so comfort is a huge deal to me as well as quality.": "3", "\u2714\ufe0f": "5", "I use it for work": "5", "Got these for my boyfriend for our anniversary, he loves timberland so he was thoroughly happy!": "5", "The leather is so soft.

I have a pair of 6\" Redwing comparable in terms of 400g insulation etc and they are much more comfortable.I give them 4 stars because of that. If the laces are \"loose\" then they are kind of ok.

I had the same pair in a women's 7 wide and it still didn't fit right. It took me so long to break them in to the point where I could comfortably wear them.

So why also different names then?I am TERRIBLY disappointed. Won't buy Timberland again!!!": "1", "I wear a 10.5 for Nike and Adiddas. Size 11 for allbirds. I got these in 10.5 and they feel a little less than a half size too big. Wearing heavier/thicker socks kind of help. Otherwise these are fantastic boots.": "4", "Disappointed, pictures don't match the color of the boot. Looks faded and rugged but that's not the case. Over priced, missed out the pair that was on sale for $60 cheaper and now it's out of stock and not being sold.

I will be returning them.": "1", "Great for dressing down": "5", "Rock with anything": "5", "Absolutely love these boots": "5", "I bought this to walk around at work. My job is mainly just walking around a warehouse and houses. I thought these being a good leather (and they are good leather) would last a while, but I was wrong. The upper is very much in good shape but where these boot fail is in the sole construction. The sole starter to peel off after only about three months of walking on them. Another thing to note is, the robber sole is very soft and will wear off very fast so keep that in mind. I wouldn't recommend these boots for any kind of work. These are for casual wear and to be stylish that's all, not very durable sole. I love Timberland boots and I will continue to buy them but I'll be careful about what I buy for work from now on.": "3", "Should come with noodle cleaning brush.": "5", "Thanks": "3", "Great product, no complaints for my child about any uncomfort and keep his feet warm": "4", "AMAZING PRODUCT": "5", "Was really difficult to get the sizing right but I love how comfortable these are + how good they look + how well they work!": "5", "They fit good": "4", "This is an everyday boot for sure! I can wear these with jeans or slacks and then are the perfect balance between casual and business with an edgy feel. Full leather uppers feels great. Not sure yet about the soles, really hoping they last. I can't tell yet, since I don't see any stitching coming through, I doubt they are goodyear welted construction or anything so I don't know how repairable they will be. Overall very happy with the boot.": "4", "I just love Timberland Boots": "5", "I wear these boots as a gardener and landscaper and love them.  I wear them until they disintegrate and I'm on a brand new pair now, breaking them in for the Spring.   My last pair survived four growing seasons of hard work, plus hikes, walks, etc. They're great boots!I wear a Ladies Size 6 and I purchase a Boys/Youth size 4.5 in these.  They're no nonsense work boots.": "5", "An outstanding boot by Timberland. And they're celebrating its 10th anniversary, well here's too many more. Comfortable right out of the box, with little to no break-in period. They do run large, as most timberland boots do, so sizing a half to a full size down is recommended. I myself went a full size down. What more to say,Stylish, stable, durable, comfortable, this boot delivers on every aspect. It holds it's own in these frigid Chicago winters and looks rugged in the spring/summer.": "5", "I was looking for a good, light, waterproof boot for the colder weathers for SoCal. These are great, but I didn't realize that they are in Men's size. I returned mine and reordered.": "4", "I love these boots only thing that I would say about them is that first break and you have to unless the entire boot and stretch it and it has two tabs on the side that get in the way of wearing the boots gotta push them on really hard but they look great": "4", "Color was not at all what is shown in the picture. Returned for different color.

It seems that Timberland's reputation as a fashionable and durable boot does not live up to the hype.

I would buy another pair .. also the Socks complements the boots very nice it's comfortable and just right": "5", "Work ready": "5", "Nice look...feel good ..": "5", "Over one year on, and worn every day. Wearing well. One boot developed a squeak from the sole. Over a month of annoyance and it finally worked itself out. Apart from my initial review, where I said these boots were one full size larger than any of my other boots, nothing further to add. Good product. Thank you.": "5", "FYI.. With Timberland boots order .5 size bigger for best comfort, I think.  I inspected the boots out of the box, everything is as it should be.  Always loved Timberland quality and this one did not disappoint.  I live in north PA and it's January,  currently freezing rain.  Feet is warm and dry.  I need to break it in more but so far I like the comfort and feel while walking on uneven ground.  I would definitely buy this again.": "5", "Comfortable for hiking, warm and waterproof.": "5", "I buy these boots every 4 months for my partner. He has severe back issues. Timberlands are the only boot that gives him some relief at work. The heals wear down quickly and that is the only reason we replace them so often. So it's about  a $25 investment per month to allow him to work comfortably. I'll take it!": "5", "Love these boots but the inside materials on the right boot dug into my ankle. Would've kept them, they are really nice -stylish, sturdy, and comfy": "4", "Great quality, comfortable, warm!": "5", "I use these for hiking. I wish the finish on the leather was more resistant then it is. The Finish Mars instantly so you have to do something before you wear them outside or they will scratch indelibly.": "4", "Being that I do a lot if standing and walking at work makes this shoe a perfect fit.": "5", "Great product and service": "5", "Comfortable and can wear long hours": "5", "These are by far the best boots I've ever owned. I'm an avid climber/hiker, and since 2018, these are the only boots I've used on trails. I've easily put hundreds of miles on these boots, and they're still going strong. I've hiked in everything from  knee high snow in the mountains, to dry summers in Joshua Tree NP, and they've held up through all the elements. If this pair ever wears out, I'm definitely buying another!": "5", "Great winter boot! Wore out the soles of my first pair after many years of use.

This is my fourth pair, and I'm equally impressed with the quality and lightweight feel of the product.  And, I was really happy with the actual color of the leather version once it arrived, thanks!": "5", "Good overall boot. The only negative is the attachment of the uppers to the sole. Looks like extra material left on the seams of the shoe were they connect. Makes it look like sloppy finishing of the shoe.": "4", "Good looking pair of comfortable boots.": "4", "It's perfect for hiking and work!!!": "5", "No need to break in.": "5", "Beautiful boots, great fit, but very poor quality. In less than 6 months boots started to fall apart and water was getting through shoes. Very disappointed": "2", "Hiking and casual use.": "5", "I work in a warehouse/hub all day.

He really loves them , I will be buying a pair for my husband next": "5", "These boots were comfortable right out of the box! Love the look and the waterproof aspect. I immediately ordered another pair of Timberland work boots so that I could wear the Mt Madssen for casual wear. Will be buying another pair for a backup just in case they discontinue this style...": "5", "Great for casual wear. May not be stable enough for hiking.": "4", "I've had several Timberland boots over the years, typically the 6\", but was looking for something a little more versatile.  These seem to be just as solid, but a little lighter and good for hiking or jobs that require a little more mobility.  Very comfortable so far (though I've only worn them once), and already being waterproof is huge for winters in New England.Only issue I have is that both boots came a little scuffed, and even the stuffing was just laid on top of them in the box (instead of inside the shoe).  The soles were still in perfect condition, so it doesn't appear they were really used, and not enough of an issue for me to exchange them.": "4", "Comfortable right out of the box. I really like the mid-high boot and the availability of the wide sizes. I use for everyday wear.": "5", "I am back to these after trying other brands.  i do a lot of dog walking in trails.  i also do facility work.

There was a series for snow and sunshine which meant snow slush, and mud and the boots performed amazingly. We hiked on and off for 5 days and my feet did not feel cold or tired at all. The boots a very comfortable and I absolutely love them.The boots were more brown (than tan as shown in the picture) out of the box, but after i wore them for a couple of days they got more tanned (not sure what is the science behind that).": "5", "I bought these because I needed a pair of boots for the fall and I am happy with the purchase. The only negative is that the laces are too long, but other than that they are comfortable and look great.": "5", "In the landscaping trade and they have really stood up": "5", "I use them for every day uses.": "4", "This is a requested gift for my son in law! He loves to hike and work in the yard.

I stay on my feet and walk at least 10 miles a day. I'll continue to buy Timberland products.": "5", "The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I have not worn the shoes long enough to write or comment anything pertaining to durability.I use these boots for work. I walk between 5-7 miles daily for work and these boots have been wonderful!This is my 3.5-4th week of wearing them daily for work. The only con that I see is that the toe area is a little stiff, other than that, this boot has been great to me so far!! So thank you Timberland for providing me with an excellent work boot!": "4", "Most comfortable boots I've ever had.": "5", "Excellent product....": "5", "Very sturdy boot...bought 2 pair!": "5", "Like the boots alot but FedEx delivery is terrible. Fedex man said repeatedly he left package on door step but my security camera doesn't lie. Bottom line, FedEx's employee lied about delivery and got away with it.

I've worn them hiking a few times now and lived in them all of last weekend. They are in fact waterproof as advertised, but that makes them a little hot (duh). They are comfy, tighten up in the right places and I felt like a mountain goat on the high rocky trails we were on. The gray nubuck is a dust magnet but cleans up easily. I love them.": "4", "I wear these boots everyday. I am considering buying a second pair so that I have one pair for everyday use and one pair for when beat up work boots won't work for the occasion.": "4", "These boots are awesome, I normally buy 2 pair a year in black, but I saw the grey and loved the color the only negative comment I have is the grey only comes in wide width so they feel a little more roomy than my usual regular size 13..Please make this color in a regular size.A loyal Timberland customer!": "5", "I used these boots to hiking in Sedona and the Grand Canyon and they were AMAZING": "5", "Boots fit great and look great...

Wouldn't wear any others.": "5", "Using as general around the yard / light work boot.  I wear size 13 and fits true to size.  Reasonable amount of cushion in sole.": "5", "I bought these boots for work as my old boots that I have bought for years were discontinued. I only wore them for about a week before the rubber toe piece began peeling away from the shoe. I was unable to return the shoes because I didn't have a receipt. So I tried to get my moneys worth anyway, and after two months the shoes are tearing at the seams, lifting from the sole, and the rubber piece at the toe has peeled back. I am very disappointed in timberlands customer service and return policy. I was told that the seams were warrantied for a year, but only with a receipt. I understand this policy, but I had proof of purchase with a bank statement and they would not honor the return. Long story short... KEEP YOUR RECEIPT or go with a company that stands behind their product.": "1", "I would use the boot for work  and everyday wear.": "5", "I got this shoe as gift. It was excellent shoe and  I would buy another in future.": "5", "From the minute my husband put these hiking boots on he said they are great, feels like they are already broken in!": "5", "Great all around": "5", "Boot is not heavy feels comfortable": "5", "Very comfortable and lightweight hiking boot. My reason for only two stars is that the tread on the soles of the boots wore out after only 3 months. I do use these for work as a groundskeeper and have put many miles on them but I had hoped to get at least a couple years of use from these boots. The leather uppers are still in good shape but they have become a safety issue on steep slopes because there isn't any tread left to prevent slipping.": "2", "Love these for work boots and they last a long time.": "5", "I love my does! They are a perfect fit.": "5", "Great, comfortable boot for hiking, working in the woods, and leisurely wearing.I wore these clearing out a disc golf course and they did wear out within a year.  They lost their waterproofing properties, but I  put them through extreme wearing and usage.": "4", "Received the box and could not believe how good looking this pair of boots is. And then I tried them on...perfect fit, size and width. Easy to slip in and comfy to wear. These are my only daily shoes ever since! My wife suggested that I change the laces to the red-colored ones, and boom, even better looking!": "5", "This is my second pair. First was the almost reddish brown color. The first pair lasted me a few years before the side stitching popped. I wear them as everyday work boots for the shipping industry and electrical work. They become extremely comfortable after you break the leather in.": "5", "Boots are very comfortable": "5", "I even put a little bit of mink oil on my pair to give them a little extra water repelling power.": "5", "Timberland is awesome stuff. These are really nice. They fit really well. I thought it was nice to get two pairs of laces. They came with the brown, but the red ones were in the box too. I am very happy. Shipping was fast. I am excited to have these boots. If the government would end all this coronavirus stupidity, I could go out and really enjoy life, and my new boots. I bet this boot would really work good on a Karens backside!": "5", "This is a great hiking boot- lightweight and comfortable with plenty of support. Fits perfectly.": "5", "Right size and very comfortable. I will sure recommend it to my friends": "5", "I bought these when my son started Boy Scouts and I still wear them often.

I hope they agree, l don't want the Carmel ones.": "3", "Work in this outside.  This is my second pair.  Great shoe": "5", "I use this for hiking. I've had this hiking boots for years and often order new ones every year or two depending on wear and tear. It's always been consistent and fits like a new glove every time.": "4", "Only Timberland guarantees waterproof!  I have gone through so many boots over the years that claim to be waterproof and they are for 2 weeks.  My Timberlands last and last.....": "5", "Need more color option. Especially navy blue.": "3", "I would use this product for walking/hiking on the streets or on the trails. Comfortable and supportive  over gravel, rocks and roots.": "5", "I've used this style of boots for over 10 years, and I just say that they are extremely comfortable, and durable.": "5", "They are lightweight and extremely comfortable": "5", "I ordered the boots and they didn't come with insoles for some reason so I'm having to jump through a lot of hoops to get timberland to send me a pair of insoles size 9 amazing": "1", "the reviews were very positive, which is why i settled on this particular boot. I'm happy to say that i agree. there was virtually no break-in period, they are as light as some sneakers i have, and very comfortable. shipping direct from timberland was quick,( i think within three days).": "5", "These boots are such an innovation of sneaker comfort with the protection to weather elements - to rough enough to handle construction work debris. Really have to try and see. Never a dissapointment.": "5", "I have been using this boot for work for the last several years. I think I am now on my sixth or seventh pair and have no reason to look for another brand. Waterproof and the sole holds up to hard daily wear.": "5", "Outstanding boot that I wear until the sole is gone - about 4 months and 1000 miles.  Good price, durable and the wide size fits my wide feet - not always true for other boots.": "5", "Bought one pair a while ago randomly and they immediately became my favorite work shoe..as a solar technician I spend a lot of time on roofs and in attics so I put lots of weird stress on boots. These held up great. Wore my first paid til the soles wore through and finally the waterproofing went away and the soles were flat so it was time to order more.": "5", "These are very light and comfortable. The waterproof is just an added benefit.I may go another color next time. Just for variety.I highly recommend.": "5", "Love these! Hiked over 2000 miles in my last pair.": "5", "He loves them. Says very comfortable and wears all day.": "5", "The only thing I would change is the little rubber toe piece on the front. mine peeled down about a quarter of an inch on both shoes. I fixed it with some shoe glue. So I would recommend timberland maybe make them a little lower so they don't rip off so easily. But the boot is beautiful, it fits great, and it's well-made. I love them.": "5", "I have been buying these boots for over 10 years great for hiking, work or every day wearing. Best in value": "5", "I use them for work, they're by far the most comfortable boot that I've ever owned. Top notch quality.": "5", "After checking online, I have selected 3 pairs of shoes from Timberland for my size of 7.  I wear 7 in size with Adidas, Rebook AICS etc. I used this pair of shoe for a walk to see  if it fits and comfortable. It started hurting my big toe and index toe. This is the same size but the shoes are bigger that other company shoes and I could not wear. So I returned all the three pairs. Yesterday this pair of shoe was returned back to me with a letter stating that they do not accept the return  if it is \"damaged, washed, altered or worn \".I have question to the company \" How do you know if it fits and is comfortable ? And do you still consider a quality shoe when it wears with one use ? I talked to the costumer service and the guy repeated the same thing. I asked him to find ways to get my money back and he said to donate or give to a friend. It is ridiculous. What is that 60 days return period ? Is it to keep in your home and return after 60 days ? This is the first time and  company I have seen who returned the product back to the costumer.I would still like to hear from them and take back their shoes and refund my money back.": "1", "Great boot , comfortable boot": "5", "Used them on a 4 hour hike.The good:The shoes have good grip. They look cool. The most good looking hiking boots I've seen. I stepped in a stream and the waterproofing held up. I've used them only once but they feel durable. Generally comfortable besides the two gripes below.The not so good:As a flat footed person, the insoles hurt my arches. However, this is the exact reason why I bought these shoes: I can simply switch out the insole for an orthopedic insole. Problem 1 solved. The second problem I ran into was when I hiked with these boots in 89 degree California weather. The shoes are not breathable and the inside of the boot gets like an oven. I now know the true importance of breathability. I mitigated this by wearing wool socks. It still gets really hot in these shoes. After these boots wear out I will opt for a more breathable option.": "3", "My husband uses them for working around the house as well as his job.": "5", "Bought for my son and he said they feel great": "5", "ITS GREAT...!!!": "5", "Great work shoes": "5", "comfortable and feels like a sneaker": "5", "Overall the shoes are great. Use them as a daily work boot for metal roofing. Grip is amazing. 10/12 pitch no problem at all. Only issue I have is the left shoe top buckle rubs against my ankle bone a lot and causes pain. Can't keep them fully laced all day. Not sure if it's my foot or the shoe.": "4", "These are my second pair.  Easy to break in and feel great on the hiking trails.": "5", "The boots fit perfect. I have been wearing two weeks now and have zero complaints. Have not gotten them wet yet. If they are water proof and last a few years, then I would rate them a five star.": "4", "Returning this product was easy.  Size was not right off!  Will try another kind.": "4", "I have been wearing the steel toe version of these they are awesome too": "5", "I bought a pair of these today and didn't get to try them on first, due to it being curbside pickup only at REI. When I tried them on at home the right one felt a little tight. The foot bed, beneath the inner sole had been poorly constructed, it had ripples or bubble up in the toe area, making it smaller and uncomfortable.It's going to cost me $8.50 to return the defective boots and I still need boots. Quality control was non-existent on this pair and I wonder if it's any better on the rest. I don't think I've ever bought defective shoes like this before.": "1", "These are my everyday work boots and they are extremely comfortable": "5", "To like good in playa": "4", "Casual wearing!

I have worked as a Facilities Manager for almost 12 years and I was a remodeling contractor before that - always on my feet! These boots simply fit. I hate the laces, so I buy a good pair of black boot laces when I buy the boots. Typically, I go through two sets of laces before I need to replace the boots. I have never torn up or worn out the leather, it is the soles that I wear out. I have never looked into replacing the soles since these boots are very affordable. I buy a new pair and use the old ones for yard work. Since these are actually hiking boots, I use them for hiking as well. Or snow boots. Or rain boots. They work for pretty much anything (except formal attire).": "5", "Bought these as my first pair of boots from Timberland,  the company's reputation being one of making quality products.Right out of the box, I was pleased: the boots were just as the picture on the website showed them to be. They looked great. Next thing, I tried them on (of course!) for a 10 fit: perfect. Not giving it a second thought, I threw the box away: looks great, feel great, I had no reason to send them back.The next day I wore them to work. It had rained overnight, the ground was wet, with puddles in some places, and there was a light drizzle. I didn't care: my boots were waterproof!Not! When I got home from work that afternoon, I took the boots off and noticed that the thick light grey socks I wore that morning were darker around the toes, parts of the arch and the heel, on both feet. Whaat?? I had worn the boots all of my 10 hour day and never felt that my feet had been wet after the short walk to the car in the parking lot that morning. I should have read the description of the boots as 'mid waterproof ' . Ok, bad pun.Be that as it may, I really like the boots: they look great, are very comfortable and strong ( apparently). My pair may have been that one pair in ten thousand that was not perfectly watertight, unfortunately.": "3", "My first pair has been through snow, mud, heat and heavy rains and stayed true to a hiking boot. I use them for mostly construction around my house but they continue to stand the test of time.": "5", "I wore them daily during winters, always wet and cold here.  They remain warm, dry and very comfortable. I bought my second pair when I finally broke one of the original laces. Replaced them from Timberland store and also bought my second pair. Also, fit and comfortable right away with same quality as the first. After a couple of months I bought my third pair of the same model. They are so good that I always want to know that I have a fresh new pair ready without question.  The price is better than \"right\" as are the shoes.": "5", "I use these boots for work.

I do light construction/remodeling work and I'm on my feet a lot. These boots provides comfort andstability. The only thing I would like to see different would be shorter shoestrings.

It just seems as though that the rubber always separates from the leather. I bought this particular model and wore them very sparingly. The rubber at the front of the boot, where it meets the top portion of Lara the/fabric has already begun to separate.": "2", "I have had the boots out in the woods twice since I received them a week ago.

I wear it when I'm in the woods because of the ankle support and the boots water resistence.  Warm in the winter.  Mine are 5 or 6 years old and the only reason I'm getting another pair is that I have spilled oil  and gasoline on them and they're stained, still great at home but not too attractive when going somewhere.": "5", "I bought these for my 12 year old grandson.

The only issues is the the shoelaces, they are round and soft so they come untied during they day. I replaced them with a flat lace, they seem to be the way to go. I had them on my other pair. That first pair lasted me 3 years. I'm a construction superintendent, I'm on my feet constantly on concrete, dirt and mud, these work great.

I was looking a boot that looks identical to this one, that I have been buying for years, but it was not waterproof. Couldn't find them, but saw these. Thought, oh well l will give them a try. They were a little stiff out of the box, but soften up pretty fast. My other boots were broke in feeling right out the box. These have thicker padding around the ankles. They feel good around the ankles, however I wear a  particular pant I like with these boots that are not very open at the bottom, so they tend to sit on top of the padded ankle support more on these boots, than my other ones. Have not wore them in the rain yet, nor had them long to comment further.": "5", "I bought this same pair 12 years ago and only need a new pair after sitting too close to a campfire.

I would get a size bigger.": "4", "Great fit true to sizes , fast shipping": "5", "I got a great value on this thanks to Finish Line. The shoe runs a little snug so I'd recommend going half a size up if possible. It's also a bit heavier on your feet due to all the cushion and padding. They feel great for ankle support and change of direction especially if you're a guard that plays ball.": "5", "I purchased theses shoes to play basketball... I like how they fit .. very comfortable, there's not hi nag that I didn't like about them .. great buy": "5", "I recently purchased my son's 2nd pair of Nike's Kyrie 6 from the Finish Line site.

The comfort of the shoe is outstanding. No problem when making moves to the basket. Grips the court like crazy.

Now they're sold out of all sizes so I can't even exchange them.": "2", "These shoes are great for everyday use and they are extremely comfortable.": "5", "These are very stable shoes that are perfect for indoor and even outdoor ball. Warning if you buy any of the white colors though  the mesh, will get dirty very easily but other than aesthetics they hold up": "5", "The Kyrie 6 is just as comfortable as it's predecessors and the styling is definitely unique. The Zoom technology will have the fit snugly at first but breaks in after a few wears. If you have a wider foot you may want to go a half size up. The flap is a little short which causes it to buckle when connecting. That's the only change i would make on this shoe. Overall a great sneaker that you can't go wrong with.": "4", "cool shoe, fit comfortably": "4", "I picked up all my pairs from FNL so far!!   Kyrie 6 is a great shoe the best so far in his signature series.  It includes a great traction pattern on the sole.  Lockdown is amazing with the strap.  This shoe is so versatile because you can rock it casually as well.   Kyrie 6 from Finish Line is an absolute winner!!!": "5", "these tennis look nice but my size gone I wanted to get them next month is there any way they can ship some more out to the stores am the only won working and my daughter and son job are ending the beginning of this month.": "5", "Great shoe great addition for that pair of eye catching kicks": "4", "Very Good For Basketball. I would say to purchase a half size up. Shoe fits like a glove. Very comfortable.": "5", "The Kyrie 6 hands down has to be one of the best sneakers Nike basketball offers for a variety of reasons. The turbo cushion set up coupled with some amazing traction make the experience under foot amazing. They run narrow as most Kyrie's do however going a half size up should give you an perfect fit and the forefoot strap just adds even more containment. I have not one complaint about the shoe, it is for sure a sneaker you need multiples colorways of.": "5", "Good for casual wear but fit kind of tight": "2", "SO I HAD TO RETURN MY ORIGINAL PAIR BECAUSE OF SIZING, BUT QUICKLY REORDERED. THESE KYRIES R FRESH AND FULL OF FLAVOR...... I CANT WAIT TO THROW TOGETHER A LIL SUMIN SUMIN...... FINISH LINE IS THE BEST AND most QUILIFIED SNEAKER SPOT IN THE MALL AND ONLINE. VERY RELIABLE \ud83d\udc4d": "5", "I got the Kyrie 6 'Enlightenment' and they are perfect, just as the Kyrie 5's are (though, like past Kyrie models, they run 1/2 t0 a full size small; trust me: buy a 1/2 size up from what you normally wear in Nike). Not the biggest fan of the velcro stripe, but it doesn't interfere with the comfort any. I get all kinds of compliments on these (second only to my Kyrie 4 70's decade kicks). Can't go wrong with Kyries": "5", "My son pretty much love all of Kyrie's shoes. The grip is amazing and it's just all around a great basketball shoe. He loves them and they're very comfortable and light on his feet!": "5", "Shoe fits tight. I returned them in exchange for the next .5 size up.": "4", "I bought these Kyrie's for pick up basketball and they are super comfy. Great shoe!": "5", "I love the way it fits. Hugs the foot without being too tight.": "5", "Overall a sold shoe nice ankle support. This color way runs half size small. I Have another color way which is true to size. All in all I would buy another pair.": "4", "I use these pairs of shoes for casual use and for playing basketball \ud83c\udfc0.": "4", "I am a size 10 in every other nike I've ever bought but these ran 1/2 size small. Once I got the right size they were great. I haven't played in them yet, cuz of the whole pandemic but I can't wait, they're very comfortable and nimble compared to my Lebrons.": "5", "The shoes didn't fit well for my foot size.": "3", "By far the best kyrie so far.": "5", "Brand new out the box the shoe fits very tight. It takes a few games to break them in.  After they are broken in the shoes fit great. They're built for quick cuts and slashes to the basket granted if your able to physically perform the moves. The shoes do not improve your basketball skills. Happy hooping": "4", "I still haven't breaked it in but so far, the traction is good. Only things i don't like so far is how hot it gets and the strap fraying the laces.": "4", "I use them every day, whether it is for basketball or for casually walking.": "5", "I had to buy this item a size up twice and it still didn't fit.": "1", "Great shoes. I love it.": "5", "I love these they are light and comfy": "5", "I use these shoes for everyday life, including basketball and just walking around. Extremely comfortable sneaker with great support.": "5", "I have been waiting to purchase a pair of Kyrie's love the look and design of the shoe but they fit a bit small, other than that it's a great sneaker.": "4", "I purchased these shoes a month ago and have only worn them once. My son has yet to wear his due to them running a half size small. The are nice shoes, I've received a lot of compliments on them. I wish the return/packaging slip was included in the box when it arrived, so they could be exchanged. Definitely order a half size larger.": "3", "MANY REVIEWER RECOMMENDED 1/2 SIZE UP. SO I BOUGHT 1/2 SIZE BIGGER THAN MY NORMAL SIZE. IT'S PERFECT FIT. THIS KYRIE 6 IS LOOKS VERY STYLISH AND VERY COMFORTABLE.": "5", "I have been wanting a pair of Kyrie's since his first signature shoe, and I finally got em. The shoe looks amazing and are really comfortable. Only problem is they are very narrow. I originally bought my true size 11 but they barely fit. I had to go a whole size up to wear them casually. If I played basketball in them I would recommend half size up because they are narrow and break in nicely.": "5", "These shoes are awesome stylish and comfortable, I surprised my son with new shoes and he loved these": "5", "Kyrie's shoes are one of the best performance basketball shoes and this one lives up to all his standards. As usual this shoe has great traction and is super responsive with the Air Zoom Turbo cushioning. The shoe fits true to size and is snug, as the past Kyrie models tend to be, especially with the mid-foot strap that give the shoe great support. This model also has great styling and comes with a lot of cool colorways. Great all-around basketball shoe out there!": "5", "I'm a fan of Kyrie, and his shoes. When I saw that they were on SALE plus 25%, I had to cop. Nuff said tho, glad I got my pair. Stay Safe and Wash Your Hands...#SemperFi": "4", "These are beautiful shoes. The details are intricate and thoughtful. The strap is useless and annoying - sticks to laces and tears them up if you're not careful.Common sizing tip with the 6's: These run a half-size small. I ordered true to size and my pinky toe was smashed into extreme discomfort. Returned and did half-size up and it's perfect!": "5", "He plays basketball and reviewed the reviews for the best sneakers to support his feet. These sneakers WON..": "5", "They look very appealing both on and off feet, fits comfortably. They are a good performer on the court with superb lateral and horizontal traction. They are good on an out door court with little frailing.": "4", "These run too small. I went 1 whole size larger than usual and they were still too tight. (I wear a size 10 with fairly narrow feet and a good arch). Maybe they need to be broken in. I just wish they fit like the Kyrie 5s.Pros: stylish, comfy, good tech in the midsoleCons: uncomfortably snug across toes and midfoot, velcro side of strap can shred the laces": "3", "The shoe is tight so I removed the insoles. That made a big difference with regards to the snug fit. Otherwise the shoe is comfortable. I feel like they run at least a half size smaller than the actual size.": "4", "I first bought the lebron 16 low size 10. They were a little big, and I sprained the same ankle twice in the same week. I decided to get a pair of highs, and went with these Kyries in a size 10. Im so glad i did. They fit so much better to size, and have not sprained an ankle since the switch. One of the better basketball shoes I have played in over my 30 years. Traction is fantastic, and the extra support with the strap is A+. Highly recommend for basketball.": "5", "Great comfort and support playing basketball, good grip for outdoor play. Highly recommend": "5", "My son loves these shoes he has the last pair that came out as well. He plays basketball in them. He says there comfortable. The grip is great on the court. Overall a great shoe. To me the design is eye catching and the symbol in the back of the shoe is always cool. It was on the past pair that was released.": "5", "Great basketball shoes. I will probably buy another pair when another colorway come out.": "5", "I have lot of shoes but not basketball-specific shoes and I chose these. The tractions are amazing with rubber wraps around the outsole moving up to mid, good cushioning, top material is breathable but still well shielded. Now, I did go a half size up as these are very narrow and small. I do have wide feet (D) but even I would highly recommend trying them before you by as half size up still needed time to break them in. Overall, great balling shoes with awesome design.": "4", "This shoe is very comfortable and fits perfectly. The design definitely is a work of art and indicative to who Kyrie is.": "5", "Good for its price point": "4", "These shoes are great for sports. Very comfortable and easy to run in. Fit is just right with lots of room around the width": "5", "My teenage son love theses shoes.

Like it's previous two predecessors, the shoe's upper composed of prime or battleknit provides a comfort to the foot that regular leather cannot provide, however unlike the 15th and 16th edition of the shoes, this shoe leaves nothing to be desired; I feel like this is the perfect culmination of 15-16.

We'll worth the money.": "5", "I wear a size 11 1/2 and when I did receive them they were very tight so I returned them for a size larger 12 1/2 and those fit pretty well so my opinion they seem to run small compared to my other shoes.

Second time wearing them the little tag on upper shoe came off on both shoes. Very tight at first. Needs to make them a bit wider. Just very disappointed that we have sewn on tags coming off makes them less valuable and very disappointed since shoes are over 200.00.": "4", "Got these on release and immediately felt they were a bit too narrow/tight on the middle of my foot.

I purchased my shoes online and received them a couple of weeks ago. I wear a 11 1/2 and these are really tight on my feet. I figured, hey let me break them in so they would loosen up. So I wear them at the gym, to work and anywhere else that would allow me to stretch them out more however there's still no change in comfort. The lesson: try them on at the store b4 you order them online.": "3", "The shoes are very nice BUT they are extremely tight width wise and are not stretching out at all.": "3", "Nice sneakers and feel good on the feet however they are a bit narrow or maybe I just need to loosen them up more.

I like the air and comfort.": "5", "I wear them and the shoes really stand out. The only issue I have is the bubble in the tongue of the shoe presses uncomfortably into the top of my foot.

The color in them is so nice and comfy also.": "4", "First, I like the look of the shoe and have gotten complements on them. Now, I find these shoes very stiff. I think the size is pretty normal. I prefer a softer feel, and find Adidas much more cushioned than Nikes. It took a good week to break these LeBrons in and the tongue is uncomfortable. I found very little cushioning, arch support or lateral support. I think these are fine for casual wear, but I don't recommend them for basketball. For this price, I expected a lot more.": "3", "I love the look of the shoe but the fitting is weird. I ordered my size and the entrance is so tight that less than half of my foot would go in.

Delivery was quick and purchasing through the new Afterpay was perfect.": "5", "I recently purchased these shoes for my husband. He is a sneaker head with a huge collection. It turned out that these were too small. He said that they are making these shoes differently now. I tried to return these in store but they store associates didn't know how to do a return because I used Afterpay at the time. He advised me to wait until they were payed for in full and return them. I waited until they were paid for and took them back just for the store associate to give me a run around and tell me that due to covid since he tried these shoes on that he could not do a return for me. He advised me to call customer service. When I called customer service I was first told that they could not find my order number in the system. She then gave me another story about how I had to go into the store to do a return. This is getting to be rediculous at this point. I demanded to speak with a manager. She put me on hold for a while and finally said that she was sorry that she could not reach a manager. However now she was surprisingly able to find my order number. She s finally sent me a return label and advised that I need to send them back in order for them to give me a refund.  Now I need to send them back and wait at least a month for a refund when this should have been taken care of in store. This was a gift.

Prior to these boots, each time it rained his shoes would get wet and cause his feet to have an odor. Since these boots it has rained a full week where we live and his feet did not get wet once nor did his feet have an odor. I plan to purchase the brown as well so that he has another color to wear and rotate for work. he wears a 10.5 and they fit just right with a little room. I don't mind the additional room because his feet tend to swell a tad from standing all day and when the temp changes.": "5", "I would consider buying a second pair in a different color.": "5", "I love Nikes, and these fit just right": "5", "I use them on the ranch super comfortable": "5", "Really like these boots, I already purchased the black ones.": "5", "I use the boots for any rainy or muddy days and I've had no problems with water getting in.": "5", "Feels good on feet": "5", "I got this boot for my husband who is currently incarcerated and he loves them,, the shoes are convenient with no bubble best out": "5", "For all occasions": "5", "My grandson couldn't wait to wear them !

I wear a size 10.5 in Nike's normally but saw some reviews saying that you need to order a size higher.

I wear these boots all year around for work and off days unless its really hot out...they are very comfortable, light weight, water proof and still look good after a year of use.

They feel real comfortable and look great with jeans rolled up.": "5", "I needed something TRULY waterproof for work that would be comfortable for a ton of walking, and these fit the bill. They are definitely more of a snow boot than a work boot, but not conspicuously so. I do find my feet getting pretty toasty in them, but I think that would be the case with anything truly waterproof. These are much more comfortable to walk in than any snow or work boot I have ever worn, but they won't replace my casual shoes. Overall I'm very pleased.": "5", "I needed a new boot and these were on sale, similar look to tims, better comfort though. Great grip for snow/Ice fully functional and very comfortable.

Almost 2-3 sizes small as a size 10 feels like an effervescent squeeze around the bridge and top of the foot. The shoe \"zips\" and over cradles your foot when placing it on.

You could \"force\" your foot into these shoes but if you're responsible about your well being I wouldn't recommend it.

The only thing for me is the way the toe box is constructed when I bend my feet such as kneeling down, the shoe crease is right on top of my big toes and is slightly annoying. You do stop noticing it after wearing them awhile though. The other big thing is they run very short. I had to get a size 12 and ive never worn above an 11 in virtually any other shoe, with a 12 they fit me like normal size.

It seems he's starting to move away from comfort and more about style. The 1's and 2.5 are my favorite for a few reasons. One i love the top of the toe strap for support and also how the design of the shoe keep you on your toes. The 3's i wasnt that big of a fan support wasnt there and the insoles felt like you were almost running bare foot. Now The 4's All though they look sleek almost like the throwback Gloves.... the insoles and the Achilles area very padded and rightfully so after all the injuries or the past few years.

Of you buy get at least 1 size larger than normal.": "3 ", "I've always been a fan of the PG line but after the 2 and 3 being so difficult to break in, and the cushion being stiff, they collect dust in the closet.

However, it felt like you had to jam your feet in as the strap is tight across the entire foot.  I figured they might stretch out so I wore them for the day.
